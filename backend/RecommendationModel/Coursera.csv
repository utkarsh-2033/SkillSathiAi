It's to the point, easy to follow, and very informative! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking a Screenplay Writing course!  The course curriculum is simple: We will adopt a professional writers room process in which you�ll write, post your work for peer review, share feedback with your peers and revise your work with the feedback you receive from your peers. That's how we do it in the real world. You will feel as if you were in a professional writers room yet no prior experience as a writer is required. I'm a proponent of Experiential Learning (Active Learning). My lectures are short (sometimes just two minutes long) and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a script writer. I will guide you but I won�t ""show"" you how to write. I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write.  Learner Review: ""I would like to thank this course instructor. It's an amazing course""  What you�ll need to get started: As mentioned above, no prior script writing experience is required. To begin with, any basic word processor will do. During week two, you can choose to download some free scriptwriting software such as Celtx or Trelby or you may choose to purchase Final Draft, the industry standard, or you can continue to use your word processor and do your own script formatting.

Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,Coursera Project Network,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/single-table-sql-queries,"In this course you�ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language.   We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts�   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you�re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It�s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That�s called �data retrieval�.   Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as �the language of relational databases�. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper.   You�ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio.   Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it�s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you�ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We�re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",Data Analysis  select (sql)  database management systems  online shopping  table (database)  data retrieval  Databases  web page  numbers (spreadsheet)  SQL information-technology data-management

"Programming Languages, Part A",University of Washington,Intermediate,4.9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages,"This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language �fits together� to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.  This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.  The course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.  The course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.  Week 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",inference  ml (programming language)  higher-order function  functional programming  type inference  pattern matching  euler's totient function  language  ?-recursive function  Computer Programming computer-science software-development

"Philosophy, Science and Religion: Philosophy and Religion",The University of Edinburgh,Intermediate,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-science-religion-2,"Philosophy, Science and Religion mark three of the most fundamental modes of thinking about the world and our place in it. Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to �pick sides� and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we�ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.  This course, entitled �Philosophy and Religion�, is the second of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series, and in this course we will ask important questions about the age-old debate between science and religion, such as:   �  What kind of conflicts are there between religion and science? �  Does current cognitive science of religion effectively explain away God? �  If there is a God who has made us so that we can know him, why do some people not believe? �  Is belief in science also a kind of fundamentalism? �  What makes us good at getting, giving, or sharing, knowledge? Is this different when it is religious knowledge?  The first course in the Philosophy, Science and Religion series, 'Science and Philosophy' was launched early in 2017 and you can sign up to it at any time. The third course ��Religion and Science��will be launched early in 2018. Completing all three courses will give you a broader understanding of this fascinating topic.

Poverty & Population: How Demographics Shape Policy,Columbia University,Advanced,4.9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/poverty-population-demographics-policy,"This course has four modules, or foci.  The first is to understand the categories of social welfare�populations, income, earnings, and assets� and some related concepts that play a very large role in shaping policy decisions: unemployment, inflation, and the minimum wage.  The second deals with the central institution of social welfare�the labor market, which largely determines how many resources a person has.  The labor market also establishes hierarchy, both through meritocracy and through categories of privilege.  The third is poverty: the differing ways we define who is poor, and how effective U.S. anti-poverty efforts have been.  The final module looks directly at federal decision making, the political organization of ideas, the structure of U.S. government, and the legislative process that shapes much of our social policy. This course addresses issues of power, oppression, and white supremacy.  The course is part of a sequence in social policy that has an HONORS TRACK. This track will prepare the learner for masters-level work in policy, which involves reading the literature, writing concise summaries and probing critiques.

Global Strategy I: How The Global Economy Works,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/global-strategy,"Starting in the late 1990s, �globalization� became a buzzword to describe the apparent integration of markets in the world economy. Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were not short of formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that forces against it are strong.  This course seeks to help you understand the forces of globalization and how cross-cultural management and the relationship of a multinational organization to various host countries is becoming more and more critical in today�s global economy. This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in today�s global business marketplace.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: �\tUnderstand how we got here and why it matters �\tUnderstand the complexities of the current globalization (not all countries are the same) �\tEvaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business �\tEvaluate when and why should we operate as multinationals  This course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

Severe to Profound Intellectual Disability: Circles of Care and Education,University of Cape Town,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-disability-care-education,"This course is about caring for and educating children (and youth) with severe to profound intellectual disability. We use the idea of 'circles' to position the child at the center of the many levels of support needed. Around the child are circles of care and education - such as the parents, family, friends, caregivers, educators, health care workers and others such as neighbors, business owners and community members. Each one has an important role to play in the life of a person with an intellectual disability and can be seen as a caregiver and educator. Although this course is aimed particularly at caregivers who work at a  special centre or in a private home, each person in the circle of care and education plays a valuable role and will find the course useful.    During the course you can gain greater understanding about intellectual disability,  levels of severity of intellectual disability and the history of intellectual disability. You will also start to understand how you can support children and youth with severe to profound intellectual disability so that they can reach their full potential and become participating members of society.  We look at lifelong learning by exploring brain development, the learning process and how to maximise the opportunities for learning.  With input from a range of experts,  we consider how best learning can be facilitated.  This includes looking at children�s learning support needs, how to go about planning activities for the learning programme as well as how to empower multiple people who work in a team to care and educate children with severe to profound intellectual disability.

Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression,The University of Melbourne,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/epigenetics,"While the human genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn�t just the sequence of your DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.    Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.  This course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.  All necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.  Epigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press.

Successful Interviewing,"University of Maryland, College Park",Advanced,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/successful-interviewing,"The goal of hiring managers is not just to hire people who need a job. It�s to hire people who believe in their organization, its mission and the work that�s involved in the job position. Every hiring manager knows: Hire people to do a job and they�ll work for your money. Hire people who believe in the work and they�ll work for their passion.  And this is not a case of �fake it until you make it.� You have to be genuine about your belief in an organization and its mission. That means you have to have researched the industry, the company, and the position � and be able to show how your goals in life align with the company�s mission. Having done so will shape the impression you convey as a candidate, the way you answer traditional questions, and the way you demonstrate that you�re the right candidate for the job.  This course is the second in a five-course specialization. We recommend that courses #1, #2 and #3 be taken in sequence. Course #4 - on resume and cover letter writing - can be taken in any sequence, while course #5 is the capstone for the specialization as a whole.  This course can be thought of as ""Interviewing I"", while course #3 is ""Interviewing II.""  Course #3 covers more Advanced interview formats, including behavioral and situational interviews - along with the special case of telephone screenings.  The logic for including telephone screenings - which happen at the start of the interview process - late in this specialization on interviewing is that those screenings, while happening early in the process, involve all the skills that you'll learn from course #1 through course #3.  As for this course, it will teach you how to:  1.\tDo thorough research on a company of your choice.  2.     Prepare for those critical first 3-5 minutes of an interview (when many recruiters say an interview is either won or lost).  3.     Prepare for the all important ""Tell Me About Yourself"" question.  4.     Prepare for traditional interview questions.  5.     Use strategies for handling the salary question.  We don't teach you salary negotiation techniques, but we do teach you  how to avoid putting yourself in a weak negotiation position.  6.\tPrepare an elevator speech - all three variations.  7.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to present professional accomplishments and qualifications in a manner that conveys benefits to a potential employer.  8.\tUse persuasive speech techniques to convince a potential employer of your interest, motivation and preparation for a particular position.  9.\tAdapt your nonverbal communication style to the expectations of English-speaking interviewers.",Strategy  canned response  show me!  interview  career  technology strategy  experience  english language  speech  self-assessment language-learning learning-english

Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking,University of Michigan,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/compthinking,"Have you ever heard that computers ""think""? Believe it or not, computers really do not think. Instead, they do exactly what we tell them to do. Programming is, ""telling the computer what to do and how to do it.""  Before you can think about programming a computer, you need to work out exactly what it is you want to tell the computer to do. Thinking through problems this way is Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking allows us to take complex problems, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions. We can present these solutions in a way that both computers and people can understand.  The course includes an introduction to computational thinking and a broad definition of each concept, a series of real-world cases that illustrate how computational thinking can be used to solve complex problems, and a student project that asks you to apply what they are learning about Computational Thinking in a real-world situation. This project will be completed in stages (and milestones) and will also include a final disaster response plan you'll share with other learners like you.  This course is designed for anyone who is just beginning programming, is thinking about programming or simply wants to understand a new way of thinking about problems critically. No prior programming is needed. The examples in this course may feel particularly relevant to a High School audience and were designed to be understandable by anyone.

Spacecraft Dynamics Capstone: Mars Mission,University of Colorado Boulder,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/capstone-mars-mission,"The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance.   Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.  Tasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.    Tasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.  Tasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.",simulation  daughter  autonomous cars  tracking  numerical analysis  Framing  computer simulation  satellite  Mechanical Engineering  physics physical-science-and-engineering physics-and-astronomy

By the end of the decade, punk and disco had challenged the excesses of the hippie aesthetic, as rock became more commercially streamlined and radio friendly. The emergence and rise of MTV transformed pop music and propelled the careers of Michael jackson and Madonna, while heavy metal and hip hop dominated the late 1980s.

The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics,University of Michigan,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/finite-element-method,"This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences. The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.  The course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an introductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not formal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a competent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional analysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the methods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite Element Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical foundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner presented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed, although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.  The development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs): elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to the physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in one dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We then move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and mass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems in vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next (unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in three dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who followed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical development to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.  Books: There are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required textbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader treatments than can be provided in any form of class:  The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.

Exploring Beethoven�s Piano Sonatas,Curtis Institute of Music,Not Calibrated,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/beethoven-piano-sonatas,"Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven�s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.  This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven�s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven�s music itself.

Introduction to Ableton Live,Berklee College of Music,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ableton-live,"The new version of Introduction to Ableton Live featuring Ableton Live 10 will launch on April 20!  In the past, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) were programs used only by audio engineers with a highly specific knowledge base, on machines inaccessible to most people. But over the past 10-15 years, DAWs and the act of recording music have evolved from being a luxury of the few to being available to the masses. Ableton Live is one such application. Used by an extremely broad range of music creators, Ableton Live not only facilitates the work of engineers, producers, and writers in professional, home, and mobile studio settings, but it is also a powerful platform for musicians on stage, in the DJ booth, and elsewhere.  In this Ableton Certified Training Center course developed by Berklee Online, you will explore some of Live�s most powerful and useful functionality: MIDI programming, audio recording, warping and processing, looping editing, mixing, performing, file management, and troubleshooting. Meant to be a springboard for those who are new to Ableton Live and/or DAWs in general, this three-week course will provide you with a strong knowledge base for using Live to take your musical ideas from conception to final recording. The course breaks down the many barriers of entry into music technology and encourages all those who wish, to create fearlessly.  Note: If you do not own Ableton Live 10, you can download the free, fully featured Ableton Live Trial. The trial version will allow you to save and export your work for 30 days.

"Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 1",The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1,"The purpose of this course is to summarize new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.  Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.  Part 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions �Who rises to the top?� and �Who gets what?�.  Part 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question �Who are we?� as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction � and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

Reproducible Research,Johns Hopkins University,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research,"This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.",rstudio  General Statistics  R Programming  language  Data Analysis  Writing  Computer Programming  markup language  Knitr  analysis data-science data-analysis

To appreciate, quite simply, means to value and to recognize that which has value�it is a way of knowing and valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship it means a research focus�a positive bias�seeking fresh understanding of dynamics described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional and life-giving.   In this context the word appreciate means to value those things of value�it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful for�it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path of life's journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in value too. Combining the three�appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as an increase in value� suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole   Leading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and manage organizations in which people thrive and perform at their best.",rethinking  Change Management  government budget balance  leadership  human development  inquiry  appreciative inquiry  experience  Leadership and Management  proposition business leadership-and-management

Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-accounting-data-analytics-visual,"Accounting has always been about analytical thinking. From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R.   We�ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be  completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.   In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations.   In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications  as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).",data clustering algorithms  analytics  tableau software  Microsoft Excel  Data Visualization  microsoft excel vba  Pivot Table  analysis  Data Analysis  software data-science data-analysis

Getting started in cryo-EM,Caltech,Not Calibrated,4.9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryo-em,"This class covers the fundamental principles underlying cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) starting with the basic anatomy of electron microscopes, an introduction to Fourier transforms, and the principles of image formation. Building upon that foundation, the class then covers the sample preparation issues, data collection strategies, and basic image processing workflows for all 3 basic modalities of modern cryo-EM: tomography, single particle analysis, and 2-D crystallography.  Philosophy: The course emphasizes concepts rather than mathematical details, taught through numerous drawings and example images.  It is meant for anyone interested in the burgeoning fields of cryo-EM and 3-D EM, including cell biologists or molecular biologists without extensive training in mathematics or imaging physics and practicing electron microscopists who want to broaden their understanding of the field.  The class is perfect as a primer for anyone who is about to be trained as a cryo-electron microscopist, or for anyone who needs an introduction to the field to be able to understand the literature or the talks and conversations they will hear at cryo-EM meetings.  Pre-requisites: The recommended prerequisites are college-freshman-level math, physics, and biochemistry.  Pace:  There are 14.5 hours of lecture videos total separated into 40 individual �modules� lasting on average 20 minutes each.  Each module has at the end a list of �concept check� questions you can use to test your knowledge of what was presented. As the modules are grouped into seven major subjects, one reasonable plan would be to go through one major subject each day.  That would mean watching a couple hours of lecture and spending another hour or so thinking through the concept check questions each day for a week.  Another reasonable plan would be to go through one module each day for a little over a month, or even three modules a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a 3-month term.  It is likely that as you then move on to actually begin using a cryo-EM or otherwise engage in the field, you will want to repeat certain modules.",goniometer  structural biology  microscope  image formation  electron microscope  single particle analysis  image file formats  protein  microbiology  protein structure life-sciences research

A Journey through Western Christianity: from Persecuted Faith to Global Religion (200 - 1650),Yale University,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/western-christianity-200-1650,"This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther�s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.   We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas� great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin�s Geneva to Elizabeth�s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.   Christianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God�s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story.

"Doping : Sports, Organizations and Sciences",University of Lausanne,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/doping,"The objective of this course is to encourage a critical understanding of doping. To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.  Doping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms. This course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of �human enhancement� to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues.  In efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.  Besides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).  Teaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU  Main Learning Outcomes  At the end of the course the participants will be able to :  1.\tIdentify the �cultural� dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms, 2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time, 3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping, 4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures, 5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out.",social norms approach  arbitration  grasp  sports law  sports  psychologies  nutrition  cheating  cycling  analysis social-sciences governance-and-society

Command Line in Linux,Coursera Project Network,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/command-line-linux,"Linux is a popular operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It has many distributions which have different interfaces for installing software, different user interfaces, and so on. One thing all of the �distros� have in common is that they all have a command line interface, or terminal. In fact, sometimes there is no user interface except the terminal itself. A Linux server running a web application on AWS, for example, may only contain the software required to run the application, and no GUI �window� system at all. It is crucial to learn the Linux command line if you are going to be a productive Linux user and/or administer a Linux server.  In this course, you will use Linux commands to navigate Linux directories, search for files, search for patterns, create files and directories, and remove files and directories.

"S�ren Kierkegaard - Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity",University of Copenhagen,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/kierkegaard,"It is often claimed that relativism, subjectivism and nihilism are typically modern philosophical problems that emerge with the breakdown of traditional values, customs and ways of life. The result is the absence of meaning, the lapse of religious faith, and feeling of alienation that is so widespread in modernity.   The Danish thinker S�ren Kierkegaard (1813-55) gave one of the most penetrating analyses of this complex phenomenon of modernity. But somewhat surprisingly he seeks insight into it not in any modern thinker but rather in an ancient one, the Greek philosopher Socrates.  In this course created by former associate professor at the S�ren Kierkegaard Research Centre, Jon Stewart, we will explore how Kierkegaard deals with the problems associated with relativism, the lack of meaning and the undermining of religious faith that are typical of modern life. His penetrating analyses are still highly relevant today and have been seen as insightful for the leading figures of Existentialism, Post-Structuralism and Post-Modernism.",literary theory  philosophy  history  faith  dialogue  irony  thought  Poetry Writing  aporia  subjectivism arts-and-humanities philosophy

"Anatomy of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis",Yale University,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/trunk-anatomy,"WARNING: THESE VIDEOS CONTAIN IMAGES OF HUMAN DISSECTION. MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME.  Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us � physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.  Learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.  In this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.  All of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.  The sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.    We hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.

"Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 2",The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2,"The purpose of this course is to summarize new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.  Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.  Part 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions �Who rises to the top?� and �Who gets what?�.   Part 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question �Who are we?� as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction � and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

No one questions the imperative need to ensure development based on personal well-being and a fair distribution of wealth.  The Challenges of a Transition for All   Until now the development of Northern countries has been based on an increasing exploitation of energy resources and a greater freedom of trade and exchange at the global scale. We now know that such a model is no longer sustainable, due to global warming and to the overexploitation of resources, which lead to health, social, and environmental disasters.  The Role of Developing Countries With that in mind, how can we ensure fair and equitable growth for all? What role do countries from the different regions in the South have to play in this complete upheaval of the current economic, trade, and political models in order to achieve an effective energy and ecological transition?    A MOOC to Respond to these Questions This free online training offers complementary perspectives from several specialists of issues related to climate change and the development of Southern countries.

Intellectual Change in Early China: Warring States and Han,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,Intermediate,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-change-early-china-the-warring-states-han,"This sequence of four courses will propose a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts�thought, literature, ritual�will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.  The first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist �conquest� of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.  The third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today�s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as ""superstition"", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.  The courses are listed below:  A Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE) A Critical Cultural History of China - Early China II: Religious Transformation in the Period of Division (220-589 CE) A Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China I: Religion and Thought in the Song, Jin, and Yuan (960-1368)  A Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China II: Structuring Values (1850-2015)",language  religion  war  shamanism  i-deas  chinese language  latex  healing  intellectual  history arts-and-humanities history
Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communication,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intercultural-communication-russians,"In the course �Understanding Russians: Contexts of Intercultural Communications"": we will:  1)\tBuild skills in the analysis of the intercultural communication process using Russian-Western communication as an example.   2)\tApply the knowledge of interrelations between different contexts of communication (cultural, institutional, professional, social, interpersonal, etc.) to the cultural history and national psychology of Russians.  The purpose of the course is to provide the students with a broad overview of the basic principles governing the past, the present and the future interactions between Russia and the West, with a focus on the culture and national psychology of Russians and Western Europeans.  For example, we will look at the cases when basic cultural values of Russians show up through the linguistic choices shaping language production which is consequently misattributed by Western partners. No matter what the language of intercultural communication is � Russian, or English � the meaning of many linguistic expressions may be reconstructed wrongly by the representatives of another culture.  Some of the basic questions we will tackle are:  �\tWhat are the concepts of culture that have the strongest influence on communication? �\tWhat are Russian basic cultural values and how they shape modern Russian consciousness? �\tWhat are the specific communication patterns of modern Russians, including those of public and electronic discourse? �\tWhat is important to know about communication with Russians in organizational contexts?  Importantly, this course is NOT just a list of practical instructions of dos and don�ts of dealing with Russians. The course contains a substantial academic component introducing the key notions and concepts of the Theory of Communication, which will be extensively introduced throughout the first few modules of the course. These theoretical grounds will be further on used as a tool for analyzing the intercultural communications with Russians.  Do you have technical problems?

"Brand Management: Aligning Business, Brand and Behaviour",University of London,Intermediate,4.9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/brand,"Professor Nader Tavassoli of London Business School contrasts traditional approaches to branding - where brands are a visual identity and a promise to customers - to brands as a customer experience delivered by the entire organisation. The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals.   The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along ""moments-that-matter"" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.  You will learn and practice the following skills:  1.\tHow to build brands from a broad organisational perspective  2.\tHow to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome)  3.\tHow to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies 4.\tHow to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally 5.\tHow to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets.   This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:  1.\tHead. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today 2.\tHeart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands � regardless of where you are in your organisation � thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation 3.\tHands.

Supply Chain Management: A Learning Perspective,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST),Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/supply-chain-management,"As a human being, we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27� LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain.   For the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it!   In this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving.",supply chain  inventory  value chain  Global Supply Chain Management  supply chain management  Strategy  chaining  global  process  Leadership and Management business business-strategy

Non-Communicable Diseases in Humanitarian Settings,University of Copenhagen,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/non-communicable-diseases-in-humanitarian-settings,"NCDs are the leading cause of death in almost every region of the world, and place a huge burden on individuals, families and societies. Humanitarian settings have a negative effect on the levels of disease, and the possibility of treatment. The importance of NCDs in global health is acknowledged by their inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals, which call for a reduction of a third in premature mortality from NCDs by 2030. However, NCDs have until recently received little attention in humanitarian settings, leaving prevention, care and treatment needs largely unaddressed among some of the most vulnerable populations. According to the World Health Organization, 70 percent of global deaths are due to NCDs. The four main disease groups which cause the greatest number of deaths are cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including asthma).  The course will provide knowledge about issues and dilemmas that occur around NCDs in humanitarian settings and possible solutions.    Why are NCDs a problem in humanitarian emergencies or crises? Natural disasters and complex emergencies, including armed conflict, have a negative effect on the levels of disease, and on the possibilities for preventing, treating and caring for people with NCDs. People living with NCDs often need continuous care to avoid disease progression, and disrupted treatment due to natural disaster or emergencies pose a large health challenge. In conflict situations and fragile contexts, the challenge of disrupted care and treatment may be exacerbated � an estimated 65 million people have been forcibly displaced by conflict, displacement lasts longer, and at times health systems and health personnel are deliberately targeted.",disasters  non-communicable disease  emergency  humanitarian  crisis  disease  Risk Factor  hamper  risk factors  Risk life-sciences public-health

"Java Inheritance, Composition and Aggregation",Coursera Project Network,Beginner,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-inheritance-composition-and-aggregation,"In this project you will create a Java application that inherits from a Car class in Java and use aggregation and composition in a class that uses one to many Car objects. Code re-use allows the developer to use tried and tested code, which results in more reliable code and saves in development time as well. In Object-Oriented Programming in a language such as Java, code re-use can be accomplished in two distinctive ways. One way is to inherit from an existing class by extending its existing functionality. A Car class for example can be extended by a Used Car class by adding a parameter to indicate the number of miles on it. Another common way to re-use code is through aggregation and composition. In aggregation, the class is made up of other existing classes that may exist independent of the parent class.   Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people to analyze and exploit that data will have a clear competitive advantage.  It's especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected by companies today are related to customer actions and marketing activities.The domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge, and may cover fancy topics such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time bidding, online campaign optimization, and so on.  But at the heart of marketing lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered: (1) who are my customers, (2) which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget on, and (3) what's the future value of my customers so I can concentrate on those who will be worth the most to the company in the future.  That's exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding your customers, scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer lifetime value is about anticipating their future value. These are the foundations of Marketing Analytics. And that's what you'll learn to do in this course.",predictive analytics  analytics  market (economics)  Stochastic Matrix  Market Analysis  customer lifetime value  Marketing  market segmentation  Data Analysis  analysis business marketing

Stalin and Stalinism in Russian History,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/stalinism,"The course presents the life and deeds of Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 till 1953. It analyses the reasons for his actions and their results, as well as the causes of his popularity in Russia today. It offers an analysis of the phenomenon of Stalinism and of its significance for Russia and beyond.  In the late 1920s � early 1930s Stalin directed the massive and rapid industrialisation of the country and the forced collectivisation of its agriculture. The industrialisation was based on forced labour, and collectivisation on repression, but both helped to create the material base for the Soviet defence industry. In the late 1930s Stalin unleashed mass terror against the Soviet people, in which millions perished. In his view this helped to rid the country of any potential internal enemies on the eve of the coming war.    The USSR, together with its allies, won the Second World War, but at the cost of dozens of millions of lives. Stalin was instrumental in creating the post-war order. The system which he created in the 1930s shaped the USSR as it was during his lifetime and for decades after his death. It also influenced the lives of millions of people beyond the Soviet borders.   The course will enable those who take it to develop an informed understanding of the Stalin era and of the phenomenon of Stalinism.   Do you have technical problems?

Developing FPGA-accelerated cloud applications with SDAccel: Theory,Politecnico di Milano,Advanced,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fpga-sdaccel-theory,"This course is for anyone passionate in learning how to develop FPGA-accelerated applications with SDAccel!  We are entering in an era in which technology progress induces paradigm shifts in computing! As a tradeoff between the two extreme characteristics of GPP and ASIC, we can find a new concept, a new idea of computing... the reconfigurable computing, which has combined the advantages of both the previous worlds. Within this context, we can say that reconfigurable computing will widely, pervasively, and gradually impact human lives. Hence, it is time that we focus on how reconfigurable computing and reconfigurable system design techniques are to be utilised for building applications.  One one hand reconfigurable computing can have better performance with respect to a software implementation but paying this in terms of time to implement. On the other hand a reconfigurable device can be used to design a system without requiring the same design time and complexity compared to a full custom solution but being beaten in terms of performance. Within this context, the Xilinx SDx tools, including the SDAccel environment, the SDSoC environment, and Vivado HLS, provide an out-of-the-box experience for system programmers looking to partition elements of a software application to run in an FPGA-based hardware element, and having that hardware work seamlessly with the rest of the application running in a processor or embedded processor.   The out-of-the-box experience will provide interesting and, let us say, �good enough� results for many applications.  However, this may not be true for you, you may be looking for better performance, data throughput, reduced latency, or to reduce the resources usage... This course is focusing exactly on this. After introducing you to the FPGAs we are going to dig more into the details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel providing you also with working examples on how to optimize the hardware logic to obtain the best of of your hardware implementations. In this case, certain attributes, directives, or pragmas, can be used to direct the compilation and synthesis of the hardware kernel, or to optimise the function of the data mover operating between the processor and the hardware logic.

Business Model Innovation,HEC Paris,Advanced,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-model,"Innovation goes beyond technology, products and processes. The new competitive landscape requires another, more holistic and strategic perspective, based on the concept of business models.  This course gives you access to the Odyssey 3.14 approach, a pioneering framework that will help you invent or reinvent business models.  This highly innovative approach has been developed by Laurence Lehmann-Ortega and H�l�ne Musikas and has proven to be a very valuable methodology for start-up entrepreneurs, business unit managers and intrapreneurs alike. It offers a practical and highly effective framework and toolbox to create, invent or reinvent business models in a very disciplined way.  The approach starts with a deep dive into the 3 pillars of the business model: - The value proposition (who are our customers and what are we offering them?) - The value architecture (how are we organized in order to deliver this value proposition to our customers in due time) - The profit equation (how the alignment between the first 2 pillars generates a profit)  14 directions are then explored in order to invent or reinvent a business model. Examples of the directions include �reducing clients overall costs�, �modifying the revenue stream�, �introducing a third party�, �eliminating a step in the value chain�, and �exploring new resources�. Illustrated by numerous examples, both iconic (Ikea, Tetra Pack, Grameen Bank�) and more recent (Airbnb, Zopa, Drive Now�), these directions stimulate your creativity to rigorously explore all possible innovation paths. Innovation becomes an adventure, an odyssey� hence the name of the approach!  Odyssey 3.14 is the result of over 15 years of research, consulting and teaching. Over 150 companies that have successfully invented or reinvented their business model have been thoroughly analyzed and will inspire you to develop your own new, innovative business model.

Understanding Financial Statements: Company Position,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-statements,"This course is designed to provide a basic understanding of financial statements with an emphasis on the balance sheet. However, to understand accounting driven financial statements, it is important to recognize that accounting is less about counting and more about measuring. �What is it that is being measured?� Well, as the course unfolds, you will learn about the three measurement questions and how the balance sheet helps to answer the first two of these questions. By touring a real company and interviewing real business people, the course describes the basic content of financial statements in a simple yet relevant context. The goal of the course is to leave a lasting impression about what balance sheet consists of and what it reveals. The next course in the Fundamentals of Accounting Specialization completes the conversation by addressing the remaining measurement question.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: �\tDescribe the purpose of a balance sheet. �\tDefine the three components of a balance sheet. �\tRecognize and understand the meaning of several items typically presented on a balance sheet.  �\tExplain the broader purpose of financial statements and the role of accounting in producing the financial statements. �\tRead and, to some extent, interpret real-world balance sheets.

Skepticism,"University of California, Irvine",Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/skepticism,"Skepticism is about doubt, and doubt is everywhere in the world around us today. There are doubts about whether man-made climate change is real, whether vaccinations are harmful, whether we can trust our politicians or our media, and so on. When is such skepticism warranted, and when does it stray into unreasonable territory? How widespread can such skepticism get while still being coherent? How might a radical skepticism have pernicious social consequences, such as by leading to relativism (and just what is relativism, and what is problematic about it)?   These are all questions that we will be engaging with in this course Along the way we will consider some important philosophical issues, such as what the nature of knowledge is, whether there are any good arguments that show that knowledge is impossible, and how a moderate skepticism might accord with an ancient conception of the good life of human flourishing, one that essentially involves the intellectual virtues.   This course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning more about philosophy, along with those who are looking for strategies to combat extremism in their communities.

Local Economic Development,Erasmus University Rotterdam,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/local-economic-development,"Welcome to this MOOC on Local Economic Development (LED). Local economic development refers to the processes by which local governments, businesses, and civil society groups get together to raise income sustainably and improve their lives in a well-defined area. It�s about creating jobs, securing livelihoods, improving infrastructure and managing local resources.  What do I learn?  We will be dealing with questions such as the following. Why does economic development take place in some areas of the world and not in others? Why doesn�t it happen in your place? What prevents people from having the lives they want to live right there? Could your region make more of the opportunities of globalization and new technologies? Did the promises of decentralization in your country fail to deliver better public services and more responsive governments? If these are the questions you are asking yourself, this is the right course for you. It explores the where, who and how of economic development.  Please have a look at our list of contents for the coming 8 weeks: 1.\tWhat is LED? What drives it? 2.\tHow does globalization shape LED? 3.\tHow does decentralisation affect LED? 4.\tHow does competitiveness affect innovation? 5.\tWhat are entrepreneurship and its dimensions? 6.\tWhy are value chains and clusters so important? 7.\tWhat are some LED strategies? 8.\tYour project  How will I learn?  In each week you will be able to access the content of the videos, suggested readings and additional videos for selective deepening. You will also find assignments that you have to complete if you want to earn a certificate for this MOOC. We will first introduce our �toolkit�, a series of theories and concepts that will help you read the situation in your locality. We will explore the main factors affecting local economic development, such as globalization, decentralisation, and competitiveness. We will discuss key components, like entrepreneurship and innovation and look into the organization of local economies into clusters, value chains and learning regions. We will conclude by deepening on some specific constructs that make local economies grow to benefit their communities. You will also contribute your ideas in the discussion forums, where you will learn from other participants around the world.   What makes this course special?  There is plenty of information in Internet on local economic development, which is mostly prepared by international donors or multilateral organisations. So what does this course do differently? First of all, the course is offered by academics that have significant published research on local economic development. This course gathers a wealth of academic knowledge that often fights the assumptions on what things are supposed to be like. Second, the instructors of this course have participated in dozens of capacity building projects in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Putting learning at the centre, they worked with communities, local governments, international donors and business associations. They often found a significant distance between theory and practice in local economic development, and this has been the basis of learning. Third, the course is acutely aware that each region is different and does not attempt to offer a one-size-fits-all recipe. It singles out key factors that drive local economic development and enables participants to do their own learning process, defining local problems and appropriate solutions. The aim of the course is that participants come up with their own ideas on how to promote local economic development.  How will I get a certificate?  If you want a certificate for participating in this MOOC, you will need to complete a small assignment each week and participate in the discussion forums. In the end of the MOOC, you will put these contributions together in one final document, your Capstone Project.   I hope you find this course exciting and that you get to share our passion for promoting local economic development.   Your instructors Dr. Georgina M.

Global Impact: Cultural Psychology,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cultural-psychology-globalization,"Globalization has brought dramatic changes to the marketplace. A proliferation of global brands brings diverse cultures to a consumer population that is also growing culturally diverse. This course enables students to understand how globalization changes consumers at a psychological level, and provides tools for imbuing brands with cultural meanings�creating iconic brands�that can resonate with global consumers. The focus is on understanding that culture exists in the mind (e.g., values and beliefs) as well as in the environment (e.g., objects, brands, and institutions), and that globalization creates multi-cultural spaces in contemporary societies. Consumers can use the cultural meaning of a brand to build their identities (i.e., assimilate the brand cultural symbolism) or reject the brand�s cultural meaning(s) (i.e., exclusionary reactions).  The course will help students identify when assimilation vs. exclusionary reactions are more likely to occur, as well as devise strategies for imbuing brands with cultural meanings that can elevate them to the status of cultural icons.   Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: �\tUnderstand how globalization impacts the psychological responses of consumers in global markets  �\tUnderstand what culture is and how it manifests itself  �\tUnderstand how brands acquire cultural meanings  �\tPredict consumers� responses to the cultural meanings in brands  �\tIdentify strategies to win-over multi-cultural consumers in globalized markets  �\tLearn how to build an iconic brand  This course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

"The Bible's Prehistory, Purpose, and Political Future",Emory University,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/bible-history,"With its walls razed to ground by Babylon�s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities�from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.     Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity�s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors� visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.",pragmatics  bible  ordered pair  religion  history  project  conquesting  israel  law  education arts-and-humanities history

Community Change in Public Health,Johns Hopkins University,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/community-public-health,"In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors. This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public�s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of �community� and the processes by which we �diagnose� or seek to understand the structure and characteristics of different types of communities.  An appreciation of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.  We examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution, deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.",efficacy  case study  u.s. securities and exchange commission  modeling  ecosystem model  community change  public health  economy  competence (human resources)  soil ecology life-sciences public-health

This course provides learners with an understanding of how trademark laws can be used to protect business innovation using a combination of lectures and case examples for discussion.  The course focus on protecting innovations with Trademark as one of several tools that can be used by companies to protect their brands and products.  In additional to learning about how trademark law works in theory, we will also discuss situations in which trademark might not be effective in protecting innovations, and will focus on the legal issues involved from a practical business perspective rather than from a purely legal viewpoint.  This course is one part of a four course series focusing on protection of business innovations using copyright, patent, trademark and strategy, and these four courses may be taken in any order that is most beneficial to students interested in learning about protecting innovation.",E-Commerce  trademarks  Intellectual Property Law  service innovation  brand  Brand Management  law  Innovation  intellectual property  grey market business business-strategy
International Leadership and Organizational Behavior,Universit� Bocconi,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/organizational-behavior,"Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad, or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team, or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context.   In this course � together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni � we�ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts � enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.  Learning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?  If you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.  We are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery.   COURSE SYLLABUS Week 1 - Leadership Acumen.

CAM and Design Manufacturing for Mechanical Engineers with Autodesk Fusion 360,Autodesk,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cam-design-manufacturing-mechanical-engineers,"With design for manufacturing, our design process focused on the design over its cost, but always keeping in mind how parts needed to be made. With manufacturing at the core of a design, we're able to fix potential problems in the design phase rather than after production. In many cases, the end product is made up of an assembly of different pieces to simplify manufacturing or to achieve specific design goals. Each piece represents a certain tolerance and put together, things might not work or fit if they weren�t accounted for in the design.   We'll take a closer look at design and detail for manufacture and create toolpaths to cut parts. Even if the end goal as an engineer isn�t to fabricate your own parts, it�s a valuable skill to understand how things are made and what design decisions can ultimately affect how something is created.     After taking this course, you'll be able to:   - Inspect a multicomponent assembly. - Identify manufacturing methods based on part inspection. - Create detailed drawings for manufacturing. - Practice creating toolpaths for manufacture.",3d modeling  Mechanical Engineering  computer-aided design  manufacturing process management  Autodesk  Geometry  process  autocad  Mechanical Design  solidworks physical-science-and-engineering mechanical-engineering
Speaking to inform:  Discussing complex ideas with clear explanations and dynamic slides,University of Washington,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/inform-speech,"In the professional realm, most speeches and presentations we give are informative in scope. A scientist needs to explain her recent research findings. A financial officer needs to report on quarterly earnings to his company�s board. A technology professional needs to educate a consumer about a new product. Any time you need to convey ideas or demonstrate a process, you�re dealing with informative speaking.    Informative speaking is a fun puzzle. You need to think from the perspective of your audience to identify what they need to hear in order to understand the key ideas. How much does the audience already know? What are the most important elements to convey? How should one convey these ideas with appropriate breadth and depth given the time constraints of the speech? This demands a strategic approach to speech design that we�ll undertake in this class.  By the end of the course, you should be able to explain complex ideas vividly and accessibly, design clear and compelling presentation slides, convey your passion for a topic while maintaining your professional credibility, and speak dynamically from notes and/or a manuscript. Learners will record speeches, providing and receiving peer feedback.",voice analysis  speech  thought  i-deas  visual communication  credibility  technical support  presentation  public speaking  audience personal-development personal-development

Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms,The University of Chicago,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/internetgiants,"This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world, especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.   The course will explore seven topics:   1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft�s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.   2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google�s practices and we will look at both of those.   3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.   4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.   5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.   6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.   7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.",intellectual property  Patent Law  intellectual  Economics  internet  .properties  market (economics)  law  Intellectual Property Law  competition law social-sciences law
Simple Recurrent Neural Network with Keras,Coursera Project Network,Advanced,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/simple-recurrent-neural-network-keras,"In this hands-on project, you will use Keras with TensorFlow as its backend to create a recurrent neural network model and train it to learn to perform addition of simple equations given in string format.

Unethical Decision Making in Organizations,University of Lausanne,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/unethical-decision-making,"This course 'Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.  About the Course  This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness.  The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.  Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context.  A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.  At the end of the course, you are able to:  1.    Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy)  2.    Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades  3.    Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context  4.    Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization    Recommended Background  No background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).  Why is this course important for me?   Currently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!  What do I need to follow this course?   We build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions.

You probably use a computer every day and in fact you are reading this on a computer!   Just because we use computers all the time, doesn't mean that we understand them, or find them easy to use. Computer Science is the science of computers, it is the field of knowledge that experts use to understand computer systems. Knowing a little computer science will help you understand the computers all around you.   This isn't a how-to course for a particular piece of software, instead you will learn some fundamental concepts that you can apply to any software or computer system. You'll apply these concepts to the kind of computer systems we use every day, including word processing applications, e-commerce, the internet and web sites. You will learn how to apply computer science concepts to solve problems in daily computer use and generally be a better computer user.   Taking this course could be the start of your career in computer science, and the course is an introduction to the Bachelors in Computer Science from University of London, but it is also for you if you just want to learn a little computer science to help you better understand the computers you use in your ordinary life.",web  Computer Architecture  Computer Science  c programming  lambda calculus  client server model  debugging  Calculus  internet  Computer Programming computer-science computer-security-and-networks

Learners involved in our programs over the decades have repeatedly told us that going over the material several times helps them progressively delve into the meaning and application of the ideas and experiences. As a result, we have designed this capstone so that it would be the third iteration of working with the ideas and experiences about effective leadership and inspiring its development in others. The first iteration was during one of the other MOOCs in terms of the videos, readings, Forum chats and reflective exercises. The second iteration was doing one of the personal learning or action learning assignments in one of the MOOCs that involved talking to others and writing an essay about the experience. If you had not done the Action learning assignment, then one of the two projects for this MOOC would involve doing it. The third is reviewing and revising your analysis of the experience as the Capstone project to show evidence that you can Be a Leader and help another Develop as a Leader.",stress  positive psychology  Benefits  emotions  compassion  coaching  leadership  motivation  mindfulness  psychologies business leadership-and-management

Assessment for Learning,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/assessmentforlearning,"For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining and learning analytics systems in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by �big data� including data persistency and student profiling.  -------------------------------- Recommended Background --------------------------------  This course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the ""learning society,"" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part ""educative.""  -------------------------------- Related Resources --------------------------------  Additional online resources are available here:  https://newlearningonline.com  -------------------------------- Take this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois --------------------------------  This course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.

"Revolutionary Ideas: Borders, Elections, Constitutions, Prisons",Rutgers the State University of New Jersey,Intermediate,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/revolutionary-ideas-borders-elections-constitutions-prisons,"What is the purpose of government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?  Even within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.   All political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world�s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Bryan Caplan, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, Jon Elster, John Hart Ely, H.L.A. Hart, Michael Huemer, Andrew Rehfeld, and Jeremy Waldron.  The aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you disagree.",Art History  crime  semantics  law  elections  Economics  Criminal Justice  prisons  constitution  prison arts-and-humanities philosophy

The Unix Workbench,Johns Hopkins University,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix,"Unix forms a foundation that is often very helpful for accomplishing other goals you might have for you and your computer, whether that goal is running a business, writing a book, curing disease, or creating the next great app. The means to these goals are sometimes carried out by writing software. Software can�t be mined out of the ground, nor can software seeds be planted in spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn�t produced in factories on an assembly line. Software is a hand-made, often bespoke good. If a software developer is an artisan, then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if you�re not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas.   This course is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu.

Intellectual Humility: Science,The University of Edinburgh,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-humility-science,"It�s clear that the world needs more intellectual humility. But how do we develop this virtue? And why do so many people still end up so arrogant? Do our own biases hold us back from becoming as intellectually humble as we could be�and are there some biases that actually make us more likely to be humble? Which cognitive dispositions and personality traits give people an edge at being more intellectually humble - and are they stable from birth, learned habits, or something in between? And what can contemporary research on the emotions tell us about encouraging intellectual humility in ourselves and others?  Experts in psychology, philosophy and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it�s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.   In this course, we will examine the following major questions about the science of intellectual humility: � How do we become intellectually humble? � What can human cognition tell us about intellectual humility? � How does arrogance develop, and how can we become more open-minded? � How do emotions affect our ability to be intellectually humble?    All lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life.   This course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility. In the previous course on the theory behind intellectual humility, we considered how to define intellectual humility, the nature of an intellectual virtue, and how we know who is intellectually humble.

Epidemics - the Dynamics of Infectious Diseases,The Pennsylvania State University,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics,"Not so long ago, it was almost guaranteed that you would die of an infectious disease. In fact, had you been born just 150 years ago, your chances of dying of an infectious disease before you've reached the tender age of 5 would have been extremely high.    Since then, science has come a long way in understanding infectious diseases - what they are, how they spread, and how they can be prevented. But diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis, or the flu are still major killers worldwide, and novel emerging diseases are a constant threat to public health. In addition, the bugs are evolving. Antibiotics, our most potent weapon against bacterial infections, are losing their power because the bacteria are becoming resistant. In this course, we'll explore the major themes of infectious diseases dynamics.  After we�ve covered the basics, we'll be looking at the dynamics of the flu, and why we're worried about flu pandemics. We'll be looking at the dynamics of childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough, which were once considered almost eradicated, but are now making a comeback. We'll explore Malaria, and use it as a case study of the evolution of drug resistance. We'll even be looking at social networks - how diseases can spread from you to your friends to your friends' friends, and so on. And of course we�ll be talking about vaccination too. We�ll also be talking about how mobile phones, social media and crowdsourcing are revolutionizing disease surveillance, giving rise to a new field of digital epidemiology. And yes, we will be talking about Zombies - not human zombies, but zombie ants whose brains are hijacked by an infectious fungus.

Firm Level Economics: Markets and Allocations,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/firm-level-economics-markets,"In this class, we will derive equilibrium outcomes across a variety of market structures. We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.  Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to: �\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations. �\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out. �\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium. Different market structures produce different levels of efficiency.   �\tExplain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets. �\tDescribe how information problems can cause inefficient outcomes. �\tUnderstand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures.

A Circular Economy of Metals: Towards a Sustainable Societal Metabolism,Universiteit Leiden,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy-metals,"Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.    A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.    In this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.    This course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.",Geology  supply chain  energy  economy  metabolism  Energy Systems  Economic Development  sustainability  circular economy  resource physical-science-and-engineering environmental-science-and-sustainability

The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.  But what is intellectual humility, anyway? And why do people seem so drawn toward intellectual arrogance? Psychologists, philosophers, theologians, and educationalists are now suggesting some answers.  In this course we try to define intellectual humility and intellectual virtues in general, and ask how we know who is humble.

Logistic Regression in R for Public Health,Imperial College London,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/logistic-regression-r-public-health,"Welcome to Logistic Regression in R for Public Health!   Why logistic regression for public health rather than just logistic regression? Well, there are some particular considerations for every data set, and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word, they're messy. Like the others in the series, this is a hands-on course, giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life, messy data, with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally, the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesn�t just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said, much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set, so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too.   By the end of this course, you will be able to:  Explain when it is valid to use logistic regression  Define odds and odds ratios  Run simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in R and interpret the output  Evaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in R  Describe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model   This course builds on skills such as hypothesis testing, p values, and how to use R, which are covered in the first two courses of the Statistics for Public Health specialisation. If you are unfamiliar with these skills, we suggest you review Statistical Thinking for Public Health and Linear Regression for Public Health before beginning this course. If you are already familiar with these skills, we are confident that you will enjoy furthering your knowledge and skills in Statistics for Public Health: Logistic Regression for Public Health.

Digital Product Management: Modern Fundamentals,University of Virginia,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-digital-product-management,"Not so long ago, the job of product manager was about assessing market data, creating requirements, and managing the hand-off to sales/marketing. Maybe you�d talk to a customer somewhere in there and they�d tell you what features they wanted. But companies that manage product that way are dying.  Being a product person today is a new game, and product managers are at the center of it. Today, particularly if your product is mostly digital, you might update it several times a day. Massive troves of data are available for making decisions and, at the same time, deep insights into customer motivation and experience are more important than ever. The job of the modern product manager is to charter a direction and create a successful working environment for all the actors involved in product success.  It�s not a simple job or an easy job, but it is a meaningful job where you�ll be learning all the time.   This course will help you along your learning journey and prepare you with the skills and perspective you need to:  Create the actionable focus to successfully manage your product (week 1) Focus your work using modern product management methods (week 2) Manage new products and explore new product ideas (week 3) Manage and amplify existing products (week 4)  This course is ideal for current product or general  managers interested in today's modern product management methods.

How to Finance and Grow Your Startup � Without VC,University of London,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/startup-financing-without-vc,"Who?   If you�re an entrepreneur at any stage of your journey, or even an aspiring one, and you need money to start or grow your business, this course is for you.   What?   This course will introduce, and help you put to use in your startup, the five models through which your customers can � and will, if you ask them! � fund your business. These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly, though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood. Until now! The five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around the world � including successes and failures � through a series of captivating no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too.   Why?   More than two generations ago, the venture capital community � VC�s, business angels, incubators, and others � convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they�ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. But the vast majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding. Are they onto something that most of today�s entrepreneurial ecosystem has missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing it faster? Perhaps not.   How?   You�ll be asked to do a series of exercises � out in the real world � to put your growing toolkit to use in your business or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business start and thrive � without venture capital. You�ll join our discussion board of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting the tools to work, just as you are. And to suit today�s fast-paced lifestyles, we�ve broken what you�ll get � short lessons, interviews, thought-provoking questions, even some optional things to read � into bite-sized chunks, so you can log in and grab them whenever and wherever you are.  And what else?  If, after checking out and perhaps completing this course, you find your company in a position where seeking venture capital turns out to be the right thing to do next, John Mullins leads an inspiring and hands-on executive education course at London Business School � this one face-to-face � called Financing the Entrepreneurial Business. There, among a room full of investors and entrepreneurs, you�ll study a series of captivating real-world cases and learn everything an entrepreneur � or an investor, for that matter � needs to know to handle the person who sits across the deal table and take an entrepreneurial business from start-up to exit.

Cultural Competence - Aboriginal Sydney,The University of Sydney,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cultural-competence-aboriginal-sydney,"This course explores some of the key themes and capabilities of cultural competence by exploring Aboriginal experiences and narratives of Sydney.    Australia was �claimed� for the British Crown in 1770, by Captain James Cook, but the invasion began in earnest when the First Fleet of British arrived in 1788 and established a penal colony in Sydney.     As a consequence Sydney is a city rich in diverse pre-colonial, colonial and contemporary sites of significance to Aboriginal peoples. Too often though our perceptions about Aboriginal peoples consign them to an ancient past or perpetuates stereotypical imaginations that Aboriginal peoples live in remote communities (Hinkson, 2010).    At the heart of this MOOC is the theme that Sovereignty was never ceded and Sydney always was and always will be Aboriginal Land. Despite this the Aboriginal presence in the city is often invisible to non-Aboriginal eyes. This course aims to bring to light marginalised narratives of Aboriginal presence in this space.  To understand hidden and marginalised narratives and experiences it is necessary to develop cultural competence capabilities. Key elements of practicing cultural competence include being able to understand and interrogate context, which in the case of Sydney includes not only learning about the peoples, places and histories of Aboriginal Sydney but to also understand issues about how knowledge is created and how dominant narratives can exclude diverse knowledges and experiences.   Course learning outcomes  1.\tDevelop knowledge about cultural competence capabilities.  2.\tDevelop a deeper and multi-layered knowledge and understanding about Aboriginal peoples, cultures and places in Sydney. 3.\tDevelop a greater understanding of how history, cultures and places are represented, contested and interpreted and how that relates to their own context.   Acknowledgement of Country  We acknowledge that this course was developed on the land of the Gadigal Peoples of the Eora nation. We pay our respect to the Traditional Owners of this land and acknowledge that the land that the University of Sydney was built on has been a place of learning for many thousands of years.",broken heart  history  dominant narrative  inner city  analysis  Culture  acceptance  Anthropology  dams  Art History arts-and-humanities history

Strategic Innovation: Building and Sustaining Innovative Organizations,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/strategic-innovation-building-and-sustaining-innovative-organizations,"Innovation strategy is about creating unique value for consumers by delivering a great product that satisfies their needs and capturing value back from consumers.  At the core of a successful innovation strategy is a great product concept. Product is an all-encompassing term that includes physical goods, intangible services, and even ideas. There are three pillars to a successful product strategy: a clear understanding of (a) the target customers (WHO), (b) the specific elements of the product offering (WHAT) that satisfies consumer needs and dovetails with company capabilities, and (c) the tactical plans to reach end consumers (HOW). The value proposition has to be embedded in a coherent business model in order to create and capture value. But well-laid innovation plans can go awry without a consideration of the business ecosystem that includes competitors, collaborators, including suppliers, distributors, and retailers, or the contextual environment in which the company operates. In an interdependent world, fostering an integrated ecosystem is critically important for companies interested in maximizing the odds of innovation success.

Transformation of the Global Food System,University of Copenhagen,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/transformation-global-food-system,"The UN predicts we will be 9-10 billion people on Earth in 2050. Providing so many people with nutritious foods is a massive challenge and one that cannot be met by simply upscaling current practices regarding food production and consumption. Providing humanity with nutritional food is at the center of all decisions related to sustainable development.  Agriculture is responsible for 80% of global deforestation. The food systems release 29% of global greenhouse gasses. We use an area equivalent to North and South America combined for the production of meat for consumption or to produce the food necessary to feed the animals we eat. 70% of fresh water use is related to agriculture. These figures are staggering, and they show us, that we need to rethink and transform the way we produce, distribute and consume food worldwide.  This course focuses on how food systems can become more sustainable. It consists of four modules where each focuses on an essential ingredient towards developing more sustainable food systems: (1) Boosting the small, (2) Transforming the big, (3) Losing less and (4) Eating smarter.

You will then retrieve data from the collection to verify the data. Finally, one of the servers will be taken down and you will observe that the data is still available through a new primary server.  Database Replication is an important aspect of Data Management. By keeping copies of a database on multiple servers, it allows continuous access to data when a database server goes down. Each replica database server should be kept on a separate physical server. This ensures that if one entire physical server become unavailable for some reason, the other database servers can still be accessed. MongoDB includes the means to handle replica in a straight-forward manner. There is one primary database server through which an application may connect to the database. Any time a write occurs to the primary server, the secondary servers are updated with the new data. When the primary server goes down, one of the secondary servers takes over as the primary server. There is a minimum of three servers required for a replica set.  Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Structuring Values in Modern China,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,Intermediate,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/structuring-values-modern-china,"This sequence of four courses will propose a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts�thought, literature, ritual�will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.  The first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist �conquest� of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.  The third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today�s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as ""superstition"", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.  The courses are listed below:  A Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE) A Critical Cultural History of China - Early China II: Religious Transformation in the Period of Division (220-589 CE) A Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China I: Religion and Thought in the Song, Jin, and Yuan (960-1368)  A Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China II: Structuring Values (1850-2015)",history  chinese language  bias  patriarchy  intellectual  Culture  economy  acceptance  popular culture  religion arts-and-humanities history

Management of Urban Infrastructures � part 1,�cole Polytechnique F�d�rale de Lausanne,Conversant,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/managing-urban-infrastructures-1,"Sustainability, Resilience and Efficiency are fundamental considerations for city managers in managing urban infrastructures. Today, more than 3.9 billion people, making up more than 54% of the global population, live in cities. Urbanization is expected to continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to 6.0 billion by 2045. This dramatic increase in urban populations will inevitably increase the demand for energy, mobility (transportation), water, and other urban services in every city around the world. Without functional governance and management structures that ensure efficient, resilient and sustainable performance in cities, the current urbanization growth might become a catastrophic risk threatening the quality of life of the humanity.  Sustainable development in 21st century can only be realized by introducing innovations in both management and operations of urban infrastructures systems. Developing management practices that effectively integrates the processes of urban planning with urban infrastructures planning and management is a challenging goal that many cities are struggling with  nowadays, but is a must for transforming cities to sustainable and resilient engines of growth in both developing and developed economies.  This course will provide you with the basic principles of urban infrastructure management that are fundamental for building prosperous cities that are sustainable, resilient and efficient.   In order to obtain a certificate for this course, the participants have to pass four graded quizzes and complete four mandatory assignments, plus a final exam. In addition to the graded assignments students have the option to write a 7-10 page peer-reviewed case study about management of energy OR transportation system in their city (on your own choice).  The best case studies will be also evaluated by our jury at IGLUS and the authors of the 3 best case studies will win a full tuition fee waiver scholarship to enroll in the IGLUS professional training program in Spring 2017.

Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part II - Maximize Social Wellbeing,Tel Aviv University,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/economic-growth-part-2,"If you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.  ""Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing"" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures:  (1) The excess burden of taxation (2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax? (3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve (4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model (5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing If you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: ""Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State"". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.  The course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths � both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.  The course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle: � Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet; � Technology as the engine of economic growth; � Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?  The curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.  After successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to: � better understand economic issues presented in the media � form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies � define and measure inequality and poverty � define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth � explain the foundations of economic growth � design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals  All these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.

Buddhism and Modern Psychology,Princeton University,Not Calibrated,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation,"The Dalai Lama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has encouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice and Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and philosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of meditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have even been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions of the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of evolutionary psychology?   This course will examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists starting to understand how meditation �works�? Would such an understanding validate meditation�or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the spiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist claims about the human mind holding up? We�ll pay special attention to some highly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn�t exist, and that much of perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as they sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And what are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can meditation make us not just happier, but better people?  All the features of this course are available for free.

Climate Adaptation in Africa,University of Cape Town,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-adaptation,"This course explores why climate change adaptation is important in the African context. Africa is considered one to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.   Historically, climate-related hazards such as drought, flooding, pest and disease outbreaks, coastal storms and heat waves have had devastating impacts on people and the environment in which they live. Often the damage knocks back progress that has been made in social and economic development, slowing down the achievement of development goals.  Climate models suggest that many of these climatic hazards will intensify as the global climate warms. Building resilience to climate risks, through adaptation, is critically important for future development in Africa.  The course will examine adaptation in theory and in practice, through a focus on four sectors that are critically important for climate resilient development in Africa: Water Security, Agriculture and Food Security, Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services and Resilient Cities.",sustainability  climate risk  resource  food security  agriculture  global  adaptation  ecosystem services  climate change  environmental economics physical-science-and-engineering environmental-science-and-sustainability

The Making of the US President: A Short History in Five Elections,The University of Edinburgh,Intermediate,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/making-us-president,"As Donald Trump takes office as the forty-fifth president of the United States, this course explores presidential elections in historical perspective, via five case studies. It tells the story of key campaigns in US history, and by doing so it investigates how politics changed over time�and how understanding the past sheds light on the current campaign. From the arrival of ""dirty politics"" to the impact of the ""digital revolution,"" the course looks at the historical background to some of the key phenomena that shaped the controversy-laden campaign of 2016.  The five elections that we'll investigate are among the most significant in American political history. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson won the presidency in a contest that encouraged politicians to reform the electoral college, the system by which presidents are still chosen. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted the outbreak of the Civil War. It's an election that helps us to understand the development of political parties. In 1968, the Vietnam War was a dominant concern for Americans, and yet foreign policy played a secondary role in Richard Nixon's victory. Twelve years later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan won an election that initiated a new era of conservatism. Finally, we'll turn our attention to the election that took Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to the White House in 2008. Many saw the Obama's success not only as revealing the impact of the digital revolution on campaign politics, but also as signaling a turn to progressivism.

Power and Sample Size for Multilevel and Longitudinal Study Designs,University of Florida,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/power-sample-size,"Power and Sample Size for Longitudinal and Multilevel Study Designs, a five-week, fully online course covers innovative, research-based power and sample size methods, and software for multilevel and longitudinal studies.  The power and sample size methods and software taught in this course can be used for any health-related, or more generally, social science-related (e.g., educational research) application.  All examples in the course videos are from real-world studies on behavioral and social science employing multilevel and longitudinal designs. The course philosophy is to focus on the conceptual knowledge to conduct power and sample size methods. The goal of the course is to teach and disseminate methods for accurate sample size choice, and ultimately, the creation of a power/sample size analysis for a relevant research study in your professional context.   Power and sample size selection is one of the most important ethical questions researchers face. Interventional studies that are too large expose human volunteer research participants to possible, and needless, harm from research. Interventional studies that are too small will fail to reach their scientific objective, again bringing possible harm to research participants, without the possibility of concomitant gain from the increase in knowledge. For observational studies in which there are no possible harms to the participants, such as observational studies, proper power ensures good stewardship of both time and money.  Most National Institutes of Health (NIH) study sections will only fund a grant if the grantee has written a compelling and accurate power and sample size analysis. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the U.S. Department of Education, also offers competitive grants requiring a compelling and accurate power and sample size analysis (Goal 3: Efficacy and Replication and Goal 4: Effectiveness/Scale-Up).   At the end of the online course, learners will be able to:  �\tUse a framework and strategy for study planning  �\tWrite study aims as testable hypotheses �\tDescribe a longitudinal and multilevel study design �\tWrite a statistical analysis plan  �\tPlan a sampling design for subgroups, e.g. racial and ethnic �\tDemonstrate the feasibility of recruitment �\tDescribe expected missing data and dropout �\tWrite a power and sample size analysis that is aligned with the planned statistical analysis  This is a five-week intensive and interactive online course. We will use a mix of instructional videos, software demonstration videos, online discussion forums, online readings, quizzes, exercise assignments, and peer-review assignments. The final course project is a peer-reviewed research study you design for future power or sample size analysis.",mixed model  unit of observation  repeated measures design  Clinical Study Design  Missing Data  Statistical Tests  sample size determination  statistical unit  Statistical Power  longitudinal study data-science probability-and-statistics
Create User Directory and Files with Linux Commands,Coursera Project Network,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-directory-files-linux-commands,"Practically everything on a Linux operating system is a directory or file. It is important to understand how the file system is structured and how to manipulate it from the command line. This allows for file management even when no GUI tools are present, which is common in a server environment. For example, in an organization it is important for new users to share a common directory and file setup to improve productivity. A system admin can add the new user and create the directory structure common to all other users in the system. The user can then customize their Linux experience by adding their own files and directories.  In this course, you will use Linux commands to create directories and files for a new user added to the system. The result will be a script to add a new user with a common directory structure.

General Chemistry: Concept Development and Application,Rice University,Not Calibrated,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/general-chemistry,"This course will cover the topics of a full year, two semester General Chemistry course.  We will use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Rice�s Connexions project.   The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the Concept Development Approach developed at Rice University.  In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.  So why use this approach?   One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them.   A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.    A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.  Recommended Background:  The class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.  Suggested Readings: Readings will be assigned from the on-line textbook �Concept Development Studies in Chemistry�, available via Rice�s Connexions project. In addition, we will suggest readings from any of the standard textbooks in General Chemistry.  A particularly good free on-line resource is Dickerson, Gray, and Haight, ""Chemical Principles, 3rd Edition"".

Generative Design for Performance and Weight Reduction,Autodesk,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-design-performance-weight-reduction,"There are many considerations and factors that play a part in designing a new product. Cost is usually a big one, but sometimes there are other factors that are the main contributors to a product's direction. With vehicles, specifically motorcycles, we see Advanced engineering practices performed on seemingly minor parts. In some instances, making a part as light as possible can have a big effect on performance. In other cases, the strength or stiffness of a part, such as a motor mount, is more critical than its mass. Generative design allows us the ability to solve for both problems at the same time and make informed design decisions without the sacrifice. In this course, we�ll explore how generative design can be applied to motorcycle parts to help reduce mass while also increasing performance.

"Leading for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education",University of Michigan,Conversant,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/leading-for-equity-diversity-inclusion,"This course is open to professionals interested in learning more about leadership in higher education for a changing demographic or interested in developing their own leadership skills. The very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics. Reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted. To accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum. We believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming�if done well�can be transformative for organizers and participants.  Course Level Objectives: Understand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities.  Describe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in a complex and contested environment. Compare legislative, governance, and public accountability and expectations in relation to contemporary issues in higher education. Analyze the strategic diversity planning process and documents of a selected institution.  Recommend innovations and opportunities for transformational change at various levels of the ecological model using the strategic diversity planning process as a tool.",leadership  education  diversity training  Communication  pedagogy  Leadership and Management  stock  resource management  Leadership Development  rethinking personal-development personal-development

Paradoxes of War,Princeton University,Not Calibrated,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/war,"The Paradoxes of War teaches us to understand that war is not only a normal part of human existence, but is arguably one of the most important factors in making us who we are. Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy �us-them� dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.  All the features of this course are available for free.

Hot Topics in Criminal Justice,Vanderbilt University,Intermediate,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/hot-topics-criminal-justice,"The American criminal justice system is in need of reform. We incarcerate too many people. We pay insufficient attention to scientific advances that can help separate out the most and least culpable and dangerous. We grant the police far too much power to use force and technological surveillance.   As a way of thinking about dealing with these problems, this course examines two over-arching issues: What should we do with people who have committed crime, and how should we identify who they are? On the first issue, we will look closely at the nature and causes of mass incarceration, the death penalty, the lawfulness and usefulness of preventive detention and risk assessment, and the role of the insanity defense and neuroscience in assessing responsibility for crime. On the second issue, we will explore the laws regulating the police use of force, the growing role of technology and big data in facilitating police surveillance and detection and deterrence of crime, and the remedies for police malfeasance, including the exclusionary rule and damages actions.   The overall goal is to help thinking individuals assess today�s criminal justice system and consider ways of making it better. After completing this course, participants should be able to:   1. Describe the mass incarceration problem in the United States and why it might exist;  2. Suggest ways of reducing incarceration;  3.

This course explores the main answers that have been given to this question in the modern West. We start with a survey of the major political theories of the Enlightenment: Utilitarianism, Marxism, and the social contract tradition. In each case, we begin with a look at classical formulations, locating them in historical context, but then shift to the contemporary debates as they relate to politics today.  Next, we turn to the rejection of Enlightenment political thinking, again exploring both classical and contemporary formulations. The last part of the course deals with the nature of, and justifications for, democratic politics, and their relations to Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment political thinking.  In addition to exploring theoretical differences among the various authors discussed, considerable attention is devoted to the practical implications of their competing arguments.

Sharpened Visions: A Poetry Workshop,California Institute of the Arts,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/poetry-workshop,"Why just write poems when you can write better ones? This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.  Though any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously �mis-used�) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all).   We'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.",language  Creativity  creative writing  Poetry Writing  thought  Writing  visual effects  music  Human Learning  line wrap and word wrap arts-and-humanities music-and-art

Economics of Money and Banking,Columbia University,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking,"The last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.  Three features of the new system are central.  Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.    Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.   Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.",crisis  Banking  Finance  shadow banking system  economy  Economics  market (economics)  global  money market  shadow banning social-sciences economics

Classical papers in molecular genetics,University of Geneva,Not Calibrated,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/papers-molecular-genetics,"You have all heard about the DNA double helix and genes. Many of you know that mutations occur randomly, that the DNA sequence is read by successive groups of three bases (the codons), that many genes encode enzymes, and that gene expression can be regulated.  These concepts were proposed on the basis of astute genetic experiments, as well as often on biochemical results. The original articles were these concepts appeared are however not frequently part of the normal curriculum of biologists, biochemists and medical students.  This course proposes to read study and discuss a small selection of these classical papers, and to put these landmarks in their historical context. Most of the authors displayed interesting personal histories and many of their contributions go beyond not only the papers we will read but probably all their scientific papers.  Our understanding of the scientific process, of the philosophy underlying the process of scientific discovery, and on the integration of new concepts is not only important for the history of science but also for the mental development of creative science.",bacteria  protein  molecular biology  biology  gene  genetics  metabolism  DNA  molecular genetics  biochemistry life-sciences basic-science

Tinkering Fundamentals: Circuits,Exploratorium,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tinkering-circuits,"The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor�one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children�s (and adults) self expression.  For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor�spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any �right� one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.  In this course, we won�t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we�ll also delve into why. We�ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We�ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we�ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you�re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!  OUR APPROACH TO TEACHING  This is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don�t be shy!  PLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We�ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it�s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.  REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS  You will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs.

Using real-life cases you will see how the genuine, generous and generative characteristics apply to the development of successful organizations. For example, you will apply the Relational Circuit to recruit effectively, or the Self-Portrait and Conversation exercises to create team cohesion and resilience to overcome crises and interpersonal conflicts. You will be able to form trustworthy relationships in spite of diverging or different views, and you will grow respect in your environment where sense will be a driver for you and your surrounding.  Leaders from different organizations, will share with you their insights about how they have applied the Savoir-Relier approach to their company and how it has made the company more resilience and competitive.",history  list of public corporations by market capitalization  experience  leadership  Communication  sources  Innovation  self-awareness  Resilience  facilitation business leadership-and-management
Cybersecurity Policy for Water and Electricity Infrastructures,University of Colorado System,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-policy-water-electricity,"This course will examine the drinking water and electricity infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as ""lifeline infrastructure"". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated ""lifeline"" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.  The Department of Energy, though, recommended voluntary application of the ES-C2M2.

Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?  Most milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.  In this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.  Course lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week.

Organising an Empire: The Assyrian Way,Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit�t M�nchen (LMU),Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/organising-empire-assyrian-way,"Discover the mighty kingdom of Assyria, which came to be the world�s first great empire three thousand years ago. From the 9th to the 7th centuries BC, during the imperial phase of Assyria�s long history, modern day northern Iraq was the central region of a state reaching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, and incorporating what is now Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as half of Israel, and wide parts of south-eastern Turkey, and Western Iran.  In its geographical extent, this state was unprecedentedly large, and the distinct geography of the Middle East, with deserts and high mountain ranges, posed challenges to communication and cohesion. What were the mechanisms that kept the Empire running? This course explores the methods the Assyrian government employed to ensure unity and maintain loyalty across vast distances, using traditional as well as innovative strategies. Some of these imperial techniques have marked parallels in the ways modern multi-national corporations are operating, others will strike you as profoundly alien.  This course focusses on how the Assyrians organised their empire by analysing key aspects, namely:  � The CEO � the king, a religious, political and military leader, who is charged to govern by his master, the god Assur;  � Home Office � the royal palace in the central region and the royal court that form the administrative centre of the state;  � The Regional Managers � the governors and client-rulers to whom local power is delegated;  � Human Resources � the Empire�s people are its most precious assets, its consumers and its key product, as the goal of the imperial project was to create �Assyrians�; an approach with lasting repercussions that still reverberate in the Middle East today; and finally  � The Fruits of Empire � it takes a lot of effort, so what are the rewards?  When we explore these topics we will contextualise them with information about the lives led by ordinary Assyrian families.  Taking this course will provide you with an overview of the political, social, religious, and military history of the world�s first superpower. It will give you insight into the geography and climatic conditions of the Middle East and contribute to your understanding of the opportunities and challenges of that region. It will present you with a vision of the Middle East at a time when its political and religious structures were very different from today.",eunuch  history  palace  middle east  Art History  organizing (management)  luxury goods  palaces  death  historiography arts-and-humanities history

Cities are back in town : sociologie urbaine pour un monde globalis�,Sciences Po,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/developpement-urbain,"La mondialisation et l'europ�anisation favorisent le d�veloppement rapide des villes � travers le monde. L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd�hui avec l'essor des m�gacit�s (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou S�oul. Au-del� de la m�tropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens � ces grandes r�gions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que � post-m�tropoles �, � villes globales �, et � r�gions m�tropolitaines globales �. Ce cours passera en revue les d�bats et les mod�les de villes et m�tropoles actuels propos�s par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les d�veloppements contemporains. Comment �tudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des m�gar�gions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on � la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-del� de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des diff�renciations masqu�es et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner � ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unit�s ind�pendantes mais doivent �tre comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais �galement de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilit�, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales d�velopp�s en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'� quel point le d�veloppement syst�matique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire �voluer les sciences sociales et contribuer � surmonter la tendance � privil�gier les comparaisons entre nations ?  Pour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, �conomiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caract�ris�e par la taille, par l'agr�gation des logements, les divisions diff�renci�es du travail, et la densit� des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entrem�ler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent diff�rents processus d'int�gration : la ville mat�rielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses b�timents, ses d�chets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des diff�rences, des repr�sentations, des id�es, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esth�tiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de s�curit� sociale, d'�ducation ; la ville sociale des r�voltes, des in�galit�s ethniques, �conomiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l��conomie de la ville : la division du travail, l'�chelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce..... Les questions urbaines classiques portant sur les in�galit�s, le logement, le gouvernement, l'int�gration, se m�lent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilit� et l'enracinement, sur le d�veloppement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes � cyborg �, sur le contr�le social et les �meutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le d�veloppement �conomique urbain.

Know Thyself - The Value and Limits of Self-Knowledge: The Examined Life,The University of Edinburgh,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/know-thyself-the-examined-life,"According to legend, inscribed on walls of the temple on the sacred site of Delphi in Ancient Greece were two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction in an effort to discover what self-knowledge is, why it might be valuable, and what, if any, limitations it might face. What is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her less wise, virtuous, or competent in certain areas than others who have this capacity, and what if anything might she do to fill that gap?  Historical sources as well as recent research in philosophy, experimental social psychology, and neuroscience will inform our investigation, in the course of which we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.  Learning Outcomes:  Learners will gain familiarity with prominent themes from Western, classical Chinese, and Buddhist approaches to our knowledge of ourselves. In the course of doing so, they will gain an appreciation of the relation of self-knowledge to wisdom, of the value of intellectual humility, as well as of methods of learning about oneself that do not depend on introspection.   Learners will also become familiar with contemporary research in experimental social psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience into the emotions, the unconscious, the role of affect in decision making, and self-deception. They will also gain an appreciation of a challenge to the assumption of a coherent, unified self that derives from the Buddhist tradition.  --- This course was created by a partnership between The University of Edinburgh and Humility & Conviction and Public Life Project, an engaged research project  based at the University of Connecticut and funded by a generous grant from the John Templeton Foundation.",human nature  philosophy of mind  socratic method  meditation  introspection  psychology of self  Social Psychology  philosophy  psychology  empiricism arts-and-humanities philosophy

Evidence-based Toxicology,Johns Hopkins University,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/evidence-based-toxicology,"Welcome to the Evidence-based Toxicology (EBT) course. In medicine and healthcare, evidence-based medicine has revolutionized the way that information is evaluated transparently and objectively. Over the past ten years, a movement in North America and Europe has attempted to translate this revolution to the field of toxicology. The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) within the department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health hosts the first chair for EBT and the secretariat for the EBT Collaboration on both sides of the Atlantic. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration in Evidence-based Medicine, the EBT Collaboration was established at the CAAT to foster the development of a process for quality assurance of new toxicity tests for the assessment of safety in humans and the environment. Regulatory safety sciences have undergone remarkably little change in the past fifty years. At the same time, our knowledge in the life sciences is doubling about every seven years. Systematic review and related evidence-based approaches are beginning to be adapted by regulatory agencies like the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the US National Toxicology Program. They provide transparent, objective, and consistent tools to identify, select, appraise, and extract evidence across studies.  This course will showcase these emerging efforts and address opportunities and challenges to the expanded use of these tools within toxicology.",General Statistics  evidence-based toxicology  p-value  external validity  Meta-Analysis  toxicity  observational error  cell culture  systematics  quality control life-sciences basic-science

We evaluate the many identities of the peninsula known as Christian Hispania, Jewish Sefarad, and Islamic al-Andalus. We trace the origins and trajectory of conflict between these communities (the Muslim conquest of Spain, Christian Reconquista, prohibitions blocking intermixing of peoples, and expulsions). We aim to understand conflicts within communities as well, such as the tensions between Christian Arian Visigoths and native Catholic Iberians or the fundamentalist North African Almohad Dynasty that rejected the Spanish Umayyad Caliphate�s preference for religious tolerance. We delve into an appreciation of collaboration and coexistence among these communities. We explore the unique role of the Jewish community who Muslims and Christians depended upon as political and cultural intermediaries as well as their intellectual collaborators. We find the history of how peoples attempted to create and manage viable diverse communities.

Mobile Interaction Design: How to Design Usable Mobile Products and Services,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Advanced,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mobile-interaction-design,"Every mobile app gives you something. It could be not only something tangible like the pair of jeans you've ordered using the app but also a piece of work like waking you up in the morning. It could be a feeling, for instance, a feeling of enjoyment obtained from watching a video clip or a feeling of closeness flashed out after receiving an old photo from a loving person via some instant messenger. That ""something"" is actually the reason why you use the app, it is the heart of the product, and in this course we will not talk about it. Surprised? You shouldn�t be. There are always two sides of a coin. There should be a person who makes that ""something"" accessible. It is astonishingly important because the use of the product loses its meaning if users can�t get what they want.  The main objective of the course is to teach you to shape mobile products and services for people�s use. To do that, you�ll need to learn: - Interaction design activities and their place in the whole product design process - User research methods with a focus on the qualitative ones - Usability inspection and empirical usability evaluation methods - The process of design creation and best practices from interaction design, information architecture and visual design fields of study with a focus on the former Interfaces of handheld devices and tablets are in the spotlight. However, the processes and techniques covered by the course can be successfully applied to design interactions with mobile web apps and wearables. It should be noted that this course does not cover topics such as design management and mobile development, and it will as well not teach you how to use wireframing and prototyping tools.  What makes the course unique is a focus on the way of thinking during a design process, the representation of a designer�s decisions in the form of design questions that make the continuous reflection on the design process possible and leads to the growth of the number of proposed design alternatives. The second unique thing about this course is a focus on the explanation of the concept of usability problems, and the processes of discovering and analysing them.  Upon completion of the course, you will be able to: - Improve designs by eliminating different kinds of interaction problems - Design huge chunks of user interfaces in the case of adding a new feature to a product - Redesign a complete app by a given set of functions (e.g., extending an existing product to a new platform)  The practical part of the course will require you to discover and eliminate interaction problems of a chosen mobile app. You will go through running guerrilla usability study, analysing gathered data, and making evidence-based design changes, which will enable you to create your first case study.  This course was designed for those who are involved in creating digital interactive products (not necessarily for mobile) but do not have considerable experience in interaction design. If you are a UX professional in a junior position, a developer, manager or visual designer, this class is for you. This is not an introductory level course, so if you are new to the field, we recommend you take the �Introduction to User Experience Design� course from Georgia Institute of Technology before taking this one. Also, parts of this course such as the aforementioned process of design creation and approach to usability inspection can be useful for experienced designers.  Do you have technical problems?

Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA),Erasmus University Rotterdam,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-comparative-analysis,"Welcome to this massive open online course (MOOC) about Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Please read the points below before you start the course. This will help you prepare well for the course and attend it properly. It will also help you determine if the course offers the knowledge and skills you are looking for.  What can you do with QCA? �\tQCA is a comparative method that is mainly used in the social sciences for the assessment of cause-effect relations (i.e. causation).  �\tQCA is relevant for researchers who normally work with qualitative methods and are looking for a more systematic way of comparing and assessing cases.  �\tQCA is also useful for quantitative researchers who like to assess alternative (more complex) aspects of causation, such as how factors work together in producing an effect. �\tQCA can be used for the analysis of cases on all levels: macro (e.g. countries), meso (e.g. organizations) and micro (e.g. individuals). �\tQCA is mostly used for research of small- and medium-sized samples and populations (10-100 cases), but it can also be used for larger groups. Ideally, the number of cases is at least 10. QCA cannot be used if you are doing an in-depth study of one case.  What will you learn in this course? �\tThe course is designed for people who have no or little experience with QCA. �\tAfter the course you will understand the methodological foundations of QCA.  �\tAfter the course you will know how to conduct a basic QCA study by yourself.   How is this course organized? �\tThe MOOC takes five weeks. The specific learning objectives and activities per week are mentioned in appendix A of the course guide. Please find the course guide under Resources in the main menu.  �\tThe learning objectives with regard to understanding the foundations of QCA and practically conducting a QCA study are pursued throughout the course. However, week 1 focuses more on the general analytic foundations, and weeks 2 to 5 are more about the practical aspects of a QCA study. �\tThe activities of the course include watching the videos, consulting supplementary material where necessary, and doing assignments. The activities should be done in that order: first watch the videos; then consult supplementary material (if desired) for more details and examples; then do the assignments. �\tThere are 10 assignments. Appendix A in the course guide states the estimated time needed to make the assignments and how the assignments are graded. Only assignments 1 to 6 and 8 are mandatory. These 7 mandatory assignments must be completed successfully to pass the course. �\tMaking the assignments successfully is one condition for receiving a course certificate. Further information about receiving a course certificate can be found here: https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819053-Get-a-Course-Certificate   About the supplementary material �\tThe course can be followed by watching the videos. It is not absolutely necessary yet recommended to study the supplementary reading material (as mentioned in the course guide) for further details and examples. Further, because some of the covered topics are quite technical (particularly topics in weeks 3 and 4 of the course), we provide several worked examples that supplement the videos by offering more specific illustrations and explanation. These worked examples can be found under Resources in the main menu. �\tNote that the supplementary readings are mostly not freely available. Books have to be bought or might be available in a university library; journal publications have to be ordered online or are accessible via a university license. �\tThe textbook by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) functions as the primary reference for further information on the topics that are covered in the MOOC. Appendix A in the course guide mentions which chapters in that book can be consulted for which week of the course. �\tThe publication by Schneider and Wagemann (2012) is comprehensive and detailed, and covers almost all topics discussed in the MOOC. However, for further study, appendix A in the course guide also mentions some additional supplementary literature. �\tPlease find the full list of references for all citations (mentioned in this course guide, in the MOOC, and in the assignments) in appendix B of the course guide.",Research Design  qualitative research  process  Qualitative Data Analysis  hand  qualitative comparative analysis  Combination  Causality  calibration  discourse analysis social-sciences governance-and-society

"Comparing Genes, Proteins, and Genomes (Bioinformatics III)",University of California San Diego,Advanced,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparing-genomes,"Once we have sequenced genomes in the previous course, we would like to compare them to determine how species have evolved and what makes them different.  In the first half of the course, we will compare two short biological sequences, such as genes (i.e., short sequences of DNA) or proteins.  We will encounter a powerful algorithmic tool called dynamic programming that will help us determine the number of mutations that have separated the two genes/proteins.  In the second half of the course, we will ""zoom out"" to compare entire genomes, where we see large scale mutations called genome rearrangements, seismic events that have heaved around large blocks of DNA over millions of years of evolution.  Looking at the human and mouse genomes, we will ask ourselves: just as earthquakes are much more likely to occur along fault lines, are there locations in our genome that are ""fragile"" and more susceptible to be broken as part of genome rearrangements?  We will see how combinatorial algorithms will help us answer this question.  Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to solve problems in sequence alignment, including BLAST.",sequence alignment  longest path problem  dnas  Bioinformatics  protein  genomics  evolution  sequence alignment algorithms  genome  human genome life-sciences health-informatics
The Brain and Space,Duke University,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-brain,"This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.  Knowing where things are is effortless.  But �under the hood,� your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo � these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain�s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain�s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.  The material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called ""Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are"", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press.   The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.  Dr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D. Professor Psychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology Duke University  www.duke.edu/~jmgroh  Jennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled ""Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are"" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).  Much of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain�s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).  Dr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master�s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.  Dr. Groh�s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.  The European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.  Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business.   The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments.   The course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.

Finding Mutations in DNA and Proteins (Bioinformatics VI),University of California San Diego,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-mutations,"In previous courses in the Specialization, we have discussed how to sequence and compare genomes. This course will cover Advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.  In the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the ""reference genome"" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and ""map"" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.  In the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.

Perhaps we have lived for money, love, fame, family and pride etc.? Therefore, we don�t seem to be satisfied even though we are full of those things. It is because that we don�t know ourselves.  Eric Fromm talked about human nature as two modes of being: �To Have� and �To Be�.  If we are �Having� the nature of possessions, we are not satisfied, and feel empty and futile. Then, how can we be �Being� the nature of our inner-selves?  Sometimes, we happened to be aware of this �Being� nature and try to change ourselves, but fail. But, because of our daily routines, it�s easily forgotten. And more it is hard to escape from our unwanted minds controlling us.  From now on, let us reflect on ourselves and look at our minds leading up to today! Don�t we achieve our goals after knowing ourselves? And let us find the �Being� nature of our original selves after escaping from the minds restraining and controlling us.  In this lecture, the definition and principle of the mind are explained in simple and clear ways. You can make sure and practice the methodology of finding the true original mind of inner-self by escaping from the false mind of possession.   Self-reflection is the first step to meditate.

VLSI CAD Part II: Layout,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/vlsi-cad-layout,"You should complete the VLSI CAD Part I: Logic course before beginning this course.  A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called �intellectual property� or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.  Recommended Background: Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.

Journey of the Universe: The Unfolding of Life,Yale University,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/journey-of-the-universe,"Journey of the Universe weaves together the discoveries of the evolutionary sciences together with humanities such as history, philosophy, art, and religion.  The course draws on the Emmy-award winning film, Journey of the Universe, and the book from Yale University Press.   Journey explores cosmic evolution as a creative process based on connection, interdependence, and emergence.  It examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.    The Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and co-evolution. As we discover these intricate processes of evolution, we awaken to the beauty and complexity of our natural environment at this critical juncture in our planetary history.",astronomy  film  materials  Geology  verse protocol  Scaling  thought  Solar Systems  species  history arts-and-humanities history

Religious Transformation in Early China: the Period of Division,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/religious-transformation-early-china-the-period-of-division,"This sequence of four courses will propose a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts�thought, literature, ritual�will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.  The first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist �conquest� of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.  The third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today�s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as ""superstition"", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.

This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business� interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.  �Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we�re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.�  T�a Obreht,  The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.

"Ethics, Technology and Engineering",Eindhoven University of Technology,Advanced,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ethics-technology-engineering,"There is an increasing attention to ethics in engineering practice. Engineers are supposed not only to carry out their work competently and skilfully, but also to be aware of the broader ethical and social implications of engineering and to be able to reflect on these.  According to the Engineering Criteria 2000 of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, engineers must have �an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility� and should ""understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context.�   This course provides an introduction to ethics in engineering and technology. It helps engineers and students in engineering to acquire the competences mentioned in the ABET criteria or comparable criteria formulated in other countries. More specifically, this course helps engineers to acquire the following moral competencies:  - Moral sensibility: the ability to recognize social and ethical issues in engineering; - Moral analysis skills: the ability to analyse moral problems in terms of facts, values, stakeholders and their interests; - Moral creativity: the ability to think out different options for action in the light of (conflicting) moral values and the relevant facts; - Moral judgement skills: the ability to give a moral judgement on the basis of different ethical theories or frameworks including professional ethics and common sense morality; - Moral decision-making skills: the ability to reflect on different ethical theories and frameworks and to make a decision based on that reflection.  With respect to these competencies, our focus is on the concrete moral problems that engineers encounter in their professional practice. With the help of concrete cases is shown how the decision to develop a technology, as well as the process of design and production, is inherently moral. The attention of the learners is drawn towards the specific moral choices that engineers face. In relation to these concrete choices learners will encounter different reasons for and against certain actions, and they will discover that these reasons can be discussed. In this way, learners become aware of the moral dimensions of technology and acquire the argumentative capacities that are needed in moral debates with stakeholders (e.g. governments, users, and commercial business departments).",principle  reason  precautionary principle  acceptability  risk assessment  virtue  ethics  arbitration  Civil Engineering  disasters physical-science-and-engineering research-methods

"Revolutionary Ideas: Utility, Justice, Equality, Freedom",Rutgers the State University of New Jersey,Beginner,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/revolutionary-ideas-utility-justice-equality-freedom,"What is the purpose of government?  Why should we have a State?  What kind of State should we have?  Even within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements.   All political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world�s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart Mill; and more contemporary theorists such as Elizabeth Anderson, Isaiah Berlin, Thomas Christiano, Frantz Fanon, Amy Gutmann, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, Martha Nussbaum, Julius Nyerere, Ayn Rand, John Rawls, Peter Singer, and Kok-Chor Tan.

A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment,Indian School of Business,Advanced,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?  This is surely one of life�s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.  How valid are our theories?  Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.  This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment.   Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure.   For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email.   The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:       - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),       - Ed Diener (�Dr. Happiness�),       - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),  By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:       - Why aren�t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could�or should�be       - What are the �7 Deadly Happiness Sins� that even the smart and the successful commit?, and       - What are the �7 Habits of the Highly Happy� and how can you implement them in your life?  By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.",psychologies  happiness  internal control  happiness at work  gratitude  flow network  mindfulness  meditation  compassion  internality life-sciences psychology

Homeland Security & Cybersecurity Connection - It's Not About the Terrorists,University of Colorado System,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/homeland-security-cybersecurity-connection,"Welcome to Course 1 in CS4950, Homeland Security and Cybersecruity. In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its connection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their ""surpassing disproportion"". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!

Chemical Biology,University of Geneva,Intermediate,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/chemical-biology,"Chemical biology is a burgeoning field that has rapidly risen to prominence. This surge of interest has been fuelled by chemical biology�s applicability to understanding critical processes in live cells or model organisms in real time. This success has arisen because chemical biology straddles a nexus between chemistry, biology, and physics. Thus, chemical biology can harness rapid chemistry to observe or perturb biological processes, that are in turn reported using physical assays, all in an otherwise unperturbed living entity.   Although its boundaries are endless, the multidisciplinary nature of chemical biology can make the field seem daunting; we beg to differ!

While it may be an overstatement to equate the two, there is little doubt that Confucianism pervades every level of Chinese culture and society. To be sure, other traditions such as Daoism and Buddhism have also left an indelible mark; nevertheless, Confucianism remains central to the shaping of the Chinese imagination.

Introduction to Particle Accelerators (NPAP MOOC),Lund University,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-particle-accelerators,"Welcome to the Nordic Particle Accelerator Program's (NPAP) Massive Open Online Courses and to the fascinating world of particle accelerators!  Did you know that in the year of 2000 there were more than 15 000 particle accelerators in the world? Yet, today it has grown to more than 30 000 of them! A third of the particle accelerators are dedicated to medical applications, such as radio therapy, and a half are used for ion implantation in semiconductor devices. Also numerous particle accelerators are used for sterilizing food. Despite these everyday life examples of small particle accelerators, it is the large accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, that most people associate with particle accelerators. There will be many new applications for particle accelerators in the future and by that there is a need for MOOCs that describe the techniques and applications of these machines..  The NPAP series of MOOCs consists of three MOOCs designed to disseminate knowledge about particle accelerator technology to impacted fields. The courses have been made possible thanks to the support of the Erasmus Plus, Strategic Partnership funding of the European Commission and thanks to the dedicated lecturers from the universities of Lund, Uppsala, Arhus, Oslo and Jyv�skyl�, and by experts from the MAX IV Laboratory and European Spallation Source (ESS), both in Lund, Sweden.   In many of the lectures we detail the MAX IV Laboratory and ESS - currently hosting the most powerful synchrotron light source and neutron source in the world.  In the MAX IV Laboratory intense X-ray beams are produced by electrons that are first accelerated to almost the speed of light, and at ESS protons will be accelerated and, by a process called spallation, generate intense beams of neutron. The X-ray and neutron beams are used for looking into matter, down to the atomic level. The MAX IV Laboratory and ESS form a unique European center of excellence for thousands of scientists that together build the world of tomorrow. We also take a closer look at the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN, in Geneva. This powerful machine has already had an immense impact on theoretical physics and will continue to contribute to our knowledge of nature for quite some time.   The first course in our NPAP series is the Introduction to Particle Accelerators. It explains how a particle accelerator can  generate light of wavelengths down to one Angstrom. It also explains how the ESS facility can create a massive flux of neutrons by accelerating protons and let them smash  into a disk of tungsten. The initial modules provide the basic knowledge about linear and circular accelerators that is required to understand other types of accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN in Geneva. We describe LHC and give an introduction to the elementary particle physics it is used for. We continue by describing some new concepts for future particle accelerators, like  plasma driven accelerators.  The second MOOC in the series is called ""Fundamentals of Particle Accelerator Technology (NPAP MOOC)"" and offers four modules: The Radio Frequency (RF) System of Accelerators; Magnet technology for accelerator;  Beam Diagnostics; Basics of Vacuum techniques.  The third MOOC is - Medical Applications of Particle Accelerators, which offers the four modules: Introduction to the course and radiotherapy;  Linear electron accelerators for radiotherapy; Proton therapy part I; Proton therapy part  II and the production of medical radionuclides.  The three MOOCs can be taken either separately or as a package. For students that intend to take all three courses we recommend that they are taken in order.    Get started and join us on this journey through the world of particle accelerators and be amazed by their importance for our lives and societies!

Combinatorics and Probability,University of California San Diego,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/combinatorics,"Counting is one of the basic mathematically related tasks we encounter on a day to day basis. The main question here is the following. If we need to count something, can we do anything better than just counting all objects one by one? Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.  In this course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.  One of the main `consumers� of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life, on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area. The practice shows that such an intuition is not easy to develop.  In the end of the course we will create a program that successfully plays a tricky and very counterintuitive dice game.  As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.  Do you have technical problems?

"Protecting Public Health in a Changing Climate:  A Primer for City, Local, and Regional Action",Johns Hopkins University,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-change,"This course is an introduction to the multiple ways our changing climate affects global population health, and to promising policy and practice responses.  More intense storms, heatwaves, and rising seas mean many, particularly the most vulnerable, now face growing risks of weather-related injury, illness, mental stress and even death. Because people care deeply about health outcomes, public health has great potential to convey the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to a warmer, more unpredictable climate.  The main message of the course is that public health must therefore �lean in� and become a more central player in climate change mitigation and adaptation.  Because climate-related health risks happen mainly at the local level, the course focuses on cities � increasingly key players in climate change policy.  Starting with an overview of the science consensus suggesting we have 10-20 years to prevent risks associated with exceeding 1.5�C of global warming and put in place adaptive policies, the course provides interactive lectures, expert interviews and case studies that build practical knowledge.  In the final assignment, participants apply course tools and strategies to a city of their choice, preparing them to contribute to climate mitigation and building health resiliency in their own local context.",public health  food security  water quality  climate change  global  Strategy  Urban Planning  mental health  Risk  Transporting life-sciences public-health
"The Power of Machine Learning: Boost Business, Accumulate Clicks, Fight Fraud, and Deny Deadbeats",SAS,Intermediate,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-power-of-machine-learning,"It's the age of machine learning. Companies are seizing upon the power of this technology to combat risk, boost sales, cut costs, block fraud, streamline manufacturing, conquer spam, toughen crime fighting, and win elections.  Want to tap that potential? It�s best to start with a holistic, business-oriented course on machine learning � no matter whether you�re more on the tech or the business side. After all, successfully deploying machine learning relies on savvy business leadership just as much as it relies on technical skill. And for that reason, data scientists aren't the only ones who need to learn the fundamentals. Executives, decision makers, and line of business managers must also ramp up on how machine learning works and how it delivers business value.  And the reverse is true as well: Techies need to look beyond the number crunching itself and become deeply familiar with the business demands of machine learning. This way, both sides speak the same language and can collaborate effectively.  This course will prepare you to participate in the deployment of machine learning � whether you'll do so in the role of enterprise leader or quant. In order to serve both types, this course goes further than typical machine learning courses, which cover only the technical foundations and core quantitative techniques. This curriculum uniquely integrates both sides � both the business and tech know-how � that are essential for deploying machine learning. It covers:  � How launching machine learning � aka predictive analytics � improves marketing, financial services, fraud detection, and many other business operations  � A concrete yet accessible guide to predictive modeling methods, delving most deeply into decision trees  � Reporting on the predictive performance of machine learning and the profit it generates  � What your data needs to look like before applying machine learning  � Avoiding the hype and false promises of �artificial intelligence�  � The social justice concerns, such as when predictive models blatantly discriminate by protected class  NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. This concentrated entry-level program is totally accessible to business leaders � and yet totally vital to data scientists who want to secure their business relevance. It's for anyone who wishes to participate in the commercial deployment of machine learning, no matter whether you'll play a role on the business side or the technical side. This includes business professionals and decision makers of all kinds, such as executives, directors, line of business managers, and consultants � as well as data scientists.  BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It contextualizes the core technology, guiding you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy a predictive model so that it delivers a business impact.  LIKE A UNIVERSITY COURSE. This course is also a good fit for college students, or for those planning for or currently enrolled in an MBA program.

Cybersecurity Policy for Aviation and Internet Infrastructures,University of Colorado System,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-policy-aviation-internet,"In this course we will examine the aviation and Internet infrastructures, and various policies that have been developed to help guide and strengthen their cybersecurity programs.  The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered ""lifeline infrastructure"" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards.

Model Thinking,University of Michigan,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking,"We live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena. We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians.   The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in Advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free.

By the end of this project, you will be able to use the LIME and H2O packages in R for automatic and interpretable machine learning, build classification models quickly with H2O AutoML and explain and interpret model predictions using LIME.   Machine learning (ML) models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Machines, Neural Networks, Stacked Ensembles, etc., are often considered black boxes. However, they are more accurate for predicting non-linear phenomena due to their flexibility. Experts agree that higher accuracy often comes at the price of interpretability, which is critical to business adoption, trust, regulatory oversight (e.g., GDPR, Right to Explanation, etc.).  As more industries from healthcare to banking are adopting ML models, their predictions are being used to justify the cost of healthcare and for loan approvals or denials. For regulated industries that use machine learning, interpretability is a requirement.  As Finale Doshi-Velez and Been Kim put it, interpretability is ""The ability to explain or to present in understandable terms to a human."".  To successfully complete the project, we recommend that you have prior experience with programming in R, basic machine learning theory, and have trained ML models in R.

Population Health: Syndemics,Universiteit Leiden,Intermediate,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/syndemics,"Do you wish to contribute to breaking cycles of ill-health in disadvantaged populations? And explore co-occurrence of diseases, such as substance abuse, infectious and chronic disease, and the relation with social factors (disparities)? Are you disappointed in the poor effectiveness of interventions for combined social and medical problems?  Then this syndemics course might provide you with some answers.   In medicine, diseases are generally approached as distinct entities, in isolation from other diseases �nd the social contexts in which the disease occurs.  However, in disadvantaged populations accumulations of risk factors intertwine with complex social problems leading to excessive burdens of disease and interventions with poor effectiveness.  For that reason, alternative approaches are needed that do not separate diseases from the contexts of inequality and health disparity in which they develop.

Words Spun Out of Images: Visual and Literary Culture in Nineteenth Century Japan,The University of Tokyo,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/visual-literary-culture-in-japan,"In their ambition to capture �real life,� Japanese painters, poets, novelists and photographers of the nineteenth century collaborated in ways seldom explored by their European contemporaries. This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic �realism� is and what it meant.  Learners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as �sister arts� but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art.",photography  history  japanese language  Culture  illustration  art  Poetry Writing  Art History  corporate spin-off  spins arts-and-humanities music-and-art

Tinkering Fundamentals: Motion and Mechanisms,Exploratorium,Intermediate,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tinkering-motion-mechanisms,"The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor�one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children�s (and adults�) self expression.  NB: This is a hands-on course, so you will need several tools and materials to do weekly activities. You are welcome to purchase only what you don't already have�or even better try to scrounge them from surplus stores! We have put together a list of recommended materials, which you can find here: http://bit.ly/motion-materials  For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor�spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any specific �right� one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on activities related to Motion and Mechanisms, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.  In this course, we won�t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we�ll also delve into why. We�ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We�ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we�ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you�re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!  OUR APPROACH TO TEACHING  This is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don�t be shy!  PLEASE NOTE: We have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We�ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers, and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it�s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague, or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.

Mind of the Universe: Science in Progress,Erasmus University Rotterdam,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/mind-of-the-universe-science-in-progress,"From William Harvey discovering the circulation of blood to Albert Einstein developing the theory of relativity: almost all scientific research starts from something odd and unexpected that hasn't been explained yet, and, subsequently, the scientist creatively imagining possible explanations for it, formulating hypotheses.  However, the problem with formulating hypotheses is the ""theory-ladenness of observation"": ones expectations and background theories curtail and determine what one observes. The best way to reduce the negative consequences of theory-ladenness of observation as much as possible, is not by adopting the highest methodological standards, but by continuing to think outside the box throughout the problem solving process, by tirelessly, creatively imagining alternative explanations and hypotheses.  In this learning experience you will be turned upside down by philosopher Tim de Mey, who will challenge you to think outside of your comfort zone. You will be challenged to reflect critically and creatively on what triggers your research, i.e., what is driving the scientist in you. Tim will show you how openness to and interaction with other disciplines generates new ideas, and how important it is that scientists, besides the possibilities of their own discipline, are also aware of its (and there) limitations. Take this challenge and you will construct the perfect out-of-the-box research question that will tease the Mind of the Universe scientists to explore even better answers in their research.  This online learning experience is a spin-off of The Mind of the Universe documentary series created by the Dutch broadcasting company VPRO and professor Robbert Dijkgraaf, Princeton University.

From Disease to Genes and Back,Novosibirsk State University,Intermediate,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/disease-genes,"Human genetics explores the genetically determined similarities and differences between human beings. This scientific discipline encompasses a variety of related fields such as molecular genetics, genomics, population genetics and medical genetics. Study of human genetics can help to find answers to questions regarding the inheritance and development of different human phenotypes. The field of medical genetics is quickly growing and dynamically developing thanks to the new technologies such as the next-generation sequencing.   Most human diseases have a genetic component. This genetic component varies by disease. Some rare diseases appear to be completely determined by the genome, whereas more common diseases arise from a complex interplay of many genes, the environment and chance. The understanding of how our genomes contribute to disease susceptibility offers the prospect of large gains: it may guide disease diagnostics and prognostics and help in developing new therapies.  The overall goal of this course is to describe how the researchers find genes responsible for different diseases and how this information is used to better understand and fight these diseases. You will learn about current approaches for finding single genetic variants underlying monogenic (Mendelian) diseases and sets of variants responsible for more complex, multifactorial ones. Furthermore, you will learn how the identification of these genetic variants makes it possible to understand how the affected biological pathways lead to disease development. During the final week of the course, we will talk more about clinical applications of the genetic findings.  Upon completing the course,  you will be able to:  - give examples of monogenic and complex disorders  - recognise patterns of Mendelian inheritance of monogenic diseases; - understand and describe principles and methods of gene mapping ; - describe the main steps and principles of genome-wide association studies (GWAS); - give examples of modern technologies that are currently used to find variants underlying human diseases; - discuss the approaches to finding causative variants underlying complex disorders; - discuss the possibilities and areas of application of genetic findings.",genetics  Cancer  cystic fibrosis  disease  gene  Human Genetics  population genetics  genomics  medical genetics  biology life-sciences basic-science

Because of a complex mix of physical, chemical, and biological constraints associated with active in-situ cleanup technologies, there has been a long standing focus on understanding natural processes that attenuate groundwater contaminant plumes.  We will build upon basic environmental science and environmental engineering principles to discover how to best implement MNA as a viable treatment for groundwater contamination plumes.  Additionally we will delve into the history behind and make predictions about the new directions for this technology.    Any professional working in the environmental remediation industry will benefit from this in-depth study of MNA.  We will use lectures, readings, and computational exercises to enhance our understanding and implementation of MNA.  At the completion of this course, students will have updated understanding and practical tools that can be applied to all possible MNA sites.",bioremediation  process  Geology  Chemical Engineering  water supply  flow network  case study  f.lux  chemistry  groundwater remediation physical-science-and-engineering environmental-science-and-sustainability

Cognitive Solutions and RPA Analytics,Automation Anywhere,Beginner,5.0,https://www.coursera.org/learn/cognitive-solutions-rpa-analytics,"Millions of companies in the world today are processing endless documents in various formats. Although Robotic Process Automation (RPA) thrives in almost every industry and is growing fast, it works well only with structured data sources. What about the data that�s not fully structured and comes in varying layouts? To address this problem, there is another aspect of RPA that is taking the industry by storm: cognitive automation.   While implementing RPA, you can deploy automations with �cognitive� capabilities. Cognitive automation uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn and understand the same way the human brain works. Thus, it assists humans in making decisions, completing tasks, or meeting goals. Using cognitive automation, you can extract semi�or unstructured data�which is 80% of all data!  Data is a precious asset. Businesses struggle to make sense of large volumes of available data and to generate a tangible value from them. Manual business processes barely contain any data that is available for capture. This is where Robotic Process Automation (or RPA) Analytics comes in. RPA bots don�t just automate business processes; they also digitize them. They take the large volume of data and interpret it in near real-time to provide actionable information.  In this course, you will be introduced to cognitive automation, the role that AI plays in it, and Automation Anywhere�s cognitive solution, IQ Bot. You will also be introduced to RPA analytics and explore how Automation Anywhere�s Web Control Room and Bot Insight can provide this functionality.   As you begin this course, you will learn the six steps to deploy cognitive automation. Next, you will explore the IQ Bot portal � Automation Anywhere�s web-based application for developing the cognitive IQ bots. You will then learn to use the portal by following the IQ Bot workflow.   Next, you will learn how RPA analytics help interpret and improve automated business processes. You will see how Bot Insight functions as an RPA analytics platform.   You will also explore the different types of RPA analytics and learn how to generate RPA analytics via two mechanisms � the Web Control Room for Operational Analytics and Bot Insight for Business Analytics and CoE Analytics.

The Technology of Music Production,Berklee College of Music,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/technology-of-music-production,"Learn about the music production process�including recording, editing, and mixing�and the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computer.  With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.      Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.   We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.       Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.   After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board�a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.      In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience.

Understanding Memory: Explaining the Psychology of Memory through Movies,Wesleyan University,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/memory-and-movies,"Welcome to Understanding Memory. Someone once said that memory is fascinating because sometimes we forget what we want to remember, sometimes we remember what we want to forget, and sometimes we remember events that never happened or never happened the way we remember them. I want to show you how memory works, why it sometimes fails, and what we can do to enhance it. Based on my recent book � Memory and Movies: What Films Can Teach Us About Memory (MIT Press, 2015) � I will provide an introduction to the scientific study of human memory by focusing on a select group of topics that hold widespread appeal.   To facilitate your understanding, I will use clips from numerous films to illustrate different aspects of memory � describing what has been learned about memory in a nontechnical way for people with no prior background in psychology.

After the Arab Spring � Democratic Aspirations and State Failure,University of Copenhagen,Beginner,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/after-the-arab-spring,"Learn why the hope and excitement of the Arab Spring is gone, why so many Arab states are falling apart, why the youth are so frustrated, why there are so many refugees, and what can be done about it.  The so-called Arab Spring appeared to end decades of exceptionalism and bring the Arab world back into the mainstream of global developments. The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.  Today, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?  This course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead �has given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.� This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?

Process Mining: Data science in Action,Eindhoven University of Technology,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining,"Process mining is the missing link between model-based process analysis and data-oriented analysis techniques. Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.  Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as ""data science in action"".  The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.  This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.  The course covers the three main types of process mining.  1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.  2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.  3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.  Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between ""business"" and ""IT"". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.  The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.  After taking this course you should: - have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining), - understand the role of Big Data in today�s society, - be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification, - be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools), - be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools), - be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks), - have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project, - be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data, - explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and - be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.",process modeling  business process  Process Mining  process  modeling  netting  petri net  conformance checking  Data Mining  Algorithms data-science data-analysis

Reason and Persuasion: Thinking Through Three Dialogues By Plato,National University of Singapore,Not Calibrated,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plato-dialogues,"In this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they're built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - ""Euthyphro"", ""Meno"", ""Republic"" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology.   Platonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.  We have a book: the new 4th edition of ""Reason and Persuasion"", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.)   The book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.  The course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more Advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons.   The results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.  Plato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven't been before.

The Language of Design: Form and Meaning,California Institute of the Arts,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-language,"In this course, critique is defined as a detailed, objective analysis of a work of graphic design and its effectiveness. Critique is an integral part of the making process for designers: it�s not just how we determine if a work of design is or is not successful, it�s how we move our work forward. Critique is also where other voices and opinions can be brought into the design process.   This course will introduce a lexicon (or vocabulary) in order for you to demonstrate clearer and more considered ways of talking about graphic design in the context of critique. Through this lexicon and a provided Critique Framework, we will model and then practice objectively describing how well a work of design functions based on specific, clearly articulated criteria. By refining this skill, you will enhance your ability to communicate about design with peers, colleagues, and clients.

Presentation skills: Speechwriting and Storytelling,National Research Tomsk State University,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/speechwriting,"�99% presentations suck!�, � said Apple former evangelist Guy Kawasaki in 2005. Up to now the situation hasn�t improved yet. Why? Most public speaking courses focus on �how� instead of �what & why�. How to stand, walk and talk during delivery with little attention paid to �what� � the quality of storytelling itself.  Thereby a usual result is a looking slightly confident speaker with mesmerizing voice delivering an obscure mess of facts, figures and claims.  In this course we take a more systematic approach, focusing on the content. How to structure your ideas, facts and data into a logical convincing story using a narrative structure. This course covers fundamentals of scriptwriting, packing, argumentation and language.

Ethical Leadership Through Giving Voice to Values,University of Virginia,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-giving-voice-to-values,"This course offers an action-oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (or GVV), an exciting new approach to values-driven leadership development in the workplace, in business education and in life.   GVV is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead it starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, but that we also want to feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively. Through positive, real life examples, pre-scripting, rehearsal and peer coaching, GVV builds the skill, the confidence and likelihood that we will act on our values more often and more successfully. Based on research and practice, with over 1,000 pilots in educational settings and companies on all seven continents, GVV helps answer the questions: �What if I were going to act on my values? What would I say and do? How could I be most effective?�  This course was developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and is taught by top-ranked faculty. You will come away from GVV with an expanded toolkit, as well as practice, in a variety of methods and techniques for voicing and enacting your own values and principles. You will develop and practice leadership skills in ""peer coaching� with other learners. Through cases and stories based on recognizable workplace, classroom and life values conflicts, you will apply the GVV techniques and �re-frames�, expanding your repertoire for possible action as well as identifying and rehearsing responses that are likely to be most effective. Through this practice, you will gain greater confidence and competence in voicing and enacting your values effectively.",leadership  enabling  thought  education  ethics  experience  choice  Leadership Development  value premium  reason business leadership-and-management

Large Marine Ecosystems: Assessment and Management,University of Cape Town,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/large-marine-ecosystems,"Focusing on the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the world, this course will introduce the concept and practice of ecosystem-based management. LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km� or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.  Because LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining.) This represents a new type of management approached - shifting from single sector-based to multi-sector assessment and management within the spatial domain of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.  Together, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach in 22 projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues. By the end of the online course, we hope you will be able to actively use this knowledge to advance sustainable development of the world�s oceans.

The app also creates text files in internal storage when needed, will write to those files, and will read from those files.  The app will interact with text files, images, strings, and a string array that are saved as resources in the project (can be accessed by reference throughout the app). This app will have a piece of text (from the strings file) asking the user to select the name of an author from a spinner (a type of drop down menu where the user selects from a set of options - from the strings file). There will be an image (ImageView) below the spinner which will change (from the drawable directory) to match whichever author the user selects. Beneath this will be a piece of text (TextView) with the name of a book and the year it was published (from the strings file) which will change to match the selected author. There will be another piece of text (TextView) which will contain an appropriate quote (read from the appropriate text file in a raw directory) from the named book  Below this quote will be two buttons, one with ""Read Review"" on it, and the second with ""Submit Review"" on it.  When the user clicks the ""Read Review"" button a TextView will appear containing a the previously submitted review (if one exists). The user will also be given the option to ""Submit Review"" whiich when clicked gives access to an imput box (EditText) into which a review can be typed.  When a ""Submit"" button is then clicked this review is written to a text file in internal storage (not resources) to a review file for that author.  If the file does not exist then the app will create the file first, then write the review to it. When the user closes the app the program will remember the final choice made by the user in their previous visit. When launched the app will also read all information in the review files in internal storage and bring the reviews into the app for use.

Intellectual Humility: Practice,The University of Edinburgh,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-humility-practice,"We live in a polarised world where all too often people talk past each other. But do you know when to believe what others say? For example, how quick should we be to accept something that someone else tells us is true, and what should we be looking out for when assessing a person's trustworthiness? Meanwhile, what should we do when we encounter disagreements with people who seem to be our equals? How and when should we adjust our beliefs, and how does the appropriate response vary depending on the evidence? These challenges may be especially important in the arena of religious disagreements. How should we weigh the evidence for and against various theistic and atheistic stances?  Experts in psychology, philosophy, theology and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions, and the results have important, real-world applications. Faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent. Political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing, and sometimes even dangerous. And whether it�s Christian fundamentalism, Islamic extremism, or militant atheism, religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance, dogma, and ignorance. The world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs, and are willing to consider the possibility that their political, religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken. The world needs more intellectual humility.  In this course. we will examine the following major questions about applied issues surrounding intellectual humility:   �         Should you believe what people say? �         How should we handle disagreement? �         What is the role of evidence in resolving religious disagreements?   All lectures are delivered by leading specialists, and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life.   This course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory, the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility. Before, we considered how to define and measure intellectual humility, what intellectual virtue is, whether we are born or can become humble, and what cognition and emotions can tell us about intellectual humility.

Manipulating Data with SQL,Coursera Project Network,Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/manipulating-data-with-sql,"In this course you will learn to write the SQL code to manipulate the data in a relational database table. You�ll begin by populating the table with data. Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database.   When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It�s much the same with designing and building database tables�the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.  As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you�ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You�ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you�ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike.   In addition to adding data to the tables, you�ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data. Managing and manipulating data are SQL�s primary purposes, and SQL coding will be a powerful addition to your tool set.

Firm Level Economics: Consumer and Producer Behavior,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Advanced,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/firm-level-economics,"All goods and services are subject to scarcity at some level. Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism � rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based � the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price �rations� the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand.   After this course, you will be able to:  �\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve. �\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve. �\tExplain equilibrium in a market. �\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium. �\tExplain elasticity of demand. �\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.

The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier �Jacobi modular forms� (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions. Motivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre�s �A Course in Arithmetic� are enough). The main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems. For some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis. (Ph.D. support might be available at CEMPI in Lille or at the Faculty of Mathematics of National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow)  Do you have technical problems?

Systems Thinking In Public Health,Johns Hopkins University,Intermediate,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/systems-thinking,"This course provides an introduction to systems thinking and systems models in public health. Problems in public health and health policy tend to be complex with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved. If an outcome depends on many interacting and adaptive parts and actors the outcome cannot be analyzed or predicted with traditional statistical methods. Systems  thinking is a core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.  An important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict the various ways in which a system might react to policy change. Systems thinking and systems models devise strategies to account for real world complexities.   This work was coordinated by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, the World Health Organization, with the aid of a grant from the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

Students will learn how JFK�s life, administration, and tragic death have influenced the general public, the media, and each of the nine U.S. presidents who followed.  Understanding the Kennedy legacy and being able to identify elements of his legacy within the context of modern politics helps understand many of the vexing problems that developed over the last half century as well as many of the challenges that confront us today.          November 22, 1963 was so powerful a moment that in the fifty years since the assassination, every U.S. President that followed JFK has used Kennedy�s words and actions in an effort to craft their own political image. Why does Kennedy�s influence persist, and will it continue? What are the effects?   We�ll address these questions and more as we explore The Kennedy Half Century.

Plant Bioinformatics,University of Toronto,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-bioinformatics,"The past 15 years have been exciting ones in plant biology. Hundreds of plant genomes have been sequenced, RNA-seq has enabled transcriptome-wide expression profiling, and a proliferation of ""-seq""-based methods has permitted protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to be determined cheaply and in a high-throughput manner. These data sets in turn allow us to generate hypotheses at the click of a mouse. For instance, knowing where and when a gene is expressed can help us narrow down the phenotypic search space when we don't see a phenotype in a gene mutant under ""normal"" growth conditions. Coexpression analyses and association networks can provide high-quality candidate genes involved in a biological process of interest. Using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and pathway visualization tools can help us make sense of our own 'omics experiments and answer the question ""what processes/pathways are being perturbed in our mutant of interest?""

Climate Change and Water in Mountains: A Global Concern,University of Geneva,Intermediate,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-changes-mountains-water,"What is climate change ? How are mountain regions affected by the evolution of water resources and their uses ? What kind of risks need to be considered ?   Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base.   In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.  This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, R�publique et Canton de Gen�ve, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.  By the end of this course, you will be able :  - to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions - to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies - to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions - to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health  - to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.  Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

Number Theory and Cryptography,University of California San Diego,Advanced,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/number-theory-cryptography,"We all learn numbers from the childhood. Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers� properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said �The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics�. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!  As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity.

A few examples are accelerators for radiotherapy which are the largest application of accelerators, altogether with more than 11000 accelerators worldwide. These accelerators range from very compact electron linear accelerators with a length of only about 1 m to large carbon ion synchrotrons with a circumference of more than 50 m and a huge rotating carbon ion gantry with a weight of 600 tons!   There are also a growing number of synchrotron light sources in the world. The light in these sources are created by electrons that are accelerated to almost the speed of light. This light can reveal the molecular structures of materials and also take x-ray pictures of the inner structure of objects. Synchrotron light sources are very important in life sciences, material sciences and chemistry. Another type of accelerators are used in spallation sources, like the European Spallation Source in Lund, Sweden. Here protons are accelerated to very large energies. They produce neutrons when they are smashed into a disc of tungsten. These neutrons are used for finding the inner structure of objects and atomic structures of materials. Finally there are many accelerators for basic physics, like the large hadron collider in Cern.  This course takes you on a journey through the technologies used in particle accelerators: The microwave system which produce the electromagnetic waves that accelerate particles; The magnet technology for the magnets that guide and focus the beam of particles;  The monitoring systems that determine the quality of the beam of particles; Finally the vacuum systems that create ultra high vacuum so that the accelerated particles do not collide with molecules and atoms.

Introduction to Learning Transfer and Life Long Learning (3L),"University of California, Irvine",Beginner,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-learning-transfer,"Learn how to identify the enablers and barriers to learning transfer. Use your own experience to categorise the processes and activities involved in learning and transferring that learning into practice. There are many criteria against which the success of training and development activities can be judged. One of the most important, however, is learning transfer. Ultimately, the success of any given training and/or development program is reflected in whether or not what is learned is applied on the job. Organisations - and indeed trainees themselves - invest large amounts of time, effort, and resources in work-related training and generally expect to see this manifested in some way back in the work setting (e.g. as observable changes to how work is conducted). However, many organisations and their people view the likelihood of transfer of training more in hope than expectation. This course will show you how to approach the goal of improving learning transfer in your organisation.",peer support  motivation  education  evaluation  training and development  customer service training  Training Programs  enabling  Training  experience business business-essentials

Fashion as Design,The Museum of Modern Art,Intermediate,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/fashion-design,"Among all objects of design, our clothes are the most universal and intimate. Like other kinds of design, fashion thrives on productive tensions between form and function, automation and craftsmanship, standardization and customization, universality and self-expression, and pragmatism and utopian vision. It exists in the service of others, and it can have profound consequences�social, political, cultural, economic, and environmental.  Fashion as Design focuses on a selection of more than 70 garments and accessories from around the world, ranging from kente cloth to jeans to 3D-printed dresses. Through these garments, we�re going to look closely at what we wear, why we wear it, how it�s made, and what it means. You�ll hear directly from a range of designers, makers, historians, and others working with clothing every day�and, in some cases, reinventing it for the future. Studio visits, interviews, and other resources introduce the history and development of each garment and their changing uses, meanings, and impact over time.   Course Learning Objectives:  Develop critical tools to appreciate and contextualize fashion design�from everyday clothing to couture garments�through many different perspectives.   Trace the history, development, and impact of garments over time, and explore how they may be reinvented.  Investigate garments through multiple lenses including politics, identity, and economics.   Understand more about the lifecycle of clothing, from its design and production to its marketing, distribution, and consumption.   Better comprehend the choices you make about fashion with respect to the visual language of dress, individual and collective identities, and issues such as labor practices, sustainability, and body politics.",Design and Product  history  Critical Thinking  Human Learning  Art History  sustainability  art  analysis  Creativity  Culture arts-and-humanities music-and-art

Before you enroll this course, we strongly recommend that you acquire the necessary pre-requisites. A number of tools, concepts, and methods are outlined in 3 MOOCS: Negotiation Fundamentals, Cross-cultural Negotiations, and Mediation & Conflict Resolution.   To be more specific, the following subjects must be mastered: - Get prepared for any negotiation;  - Avoid traps; - Know how to prompt value-creating partnerships; - Structure an effective negotiation sequence;  - Bargain in an efficient and respectful manner;  - Overcome deadlocks; - Manager cultural differences in a negotiation; - Define what a mediation is and choose when to use it; - List different types of mediation; - Identify typical challenges and difficulties that most mediators face; - Choose the adequate strategies within a repertoire of options; - Identify the do�s and don�ts in mediation.  The purpose of this course is to help you to put everything together, sharpen your skills and enhance your command of negotiation techniques and behaviors.  We�ve designed this MOOC in a highly interactive way. You will be engaged in a negotiation with peers.  You will demonstrate your improved capacity to analyze, and therefore conduct, negotiations and mediation.  This capstone project will comprise three exercises. Here is an overview.  In the first exercise, you will analyse a real-life negotiation of your own choice. As an expert of negotiation dynamics, you will provide your reader with a detailed analysis of this real negotiation. Indeed as a professional, your task might not always be to conduct a negotiation - but to analyse what is going on in a given negotiation, or to help others (your boss, for instance) get ready for a high-stake negotiation. Guidelines will be provided in a separate document, to help you structure your assignment.   For the second exercise, you will negotiate directly with a peer. We�ve prepared a business case inspired from a true story.   The third exercise is linked to the previous one. Imagine that this negotiation is not successful, and that the relationship between the two negotiators becomes too tense. You will be asked to step into the shoes of a mediator - and to structure a mediation process.   Each of these three exercises will be peer-evaluated.   As a result, it is really worth your engagement! Go ahead, engage fully into the exercises - you will have fun, and you will make further progress for real-life negotiation, mediation, and conflict management.",project  conflict resolution  Negotiation  process  modeling  business administration  evaluation  choice  arbitration  analysis business leadership-and-management

Constitutional Struggles in the Muslim World,University of Copenhagen,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/muslim-world,"Learn what motivates the restive Muslim youth from Tunis to Tehran, what political positions Islamists from Mali to Chechnya are fighting for, where the seeming obsession with Islamic law comes from, where the secularists have vanished to, and whether it makes sense to speak of an Islamic state.  Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of popular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but generally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or been swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not fared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social decline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are being challenged, often very violently. This course is a survey of the constitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th century throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on the actors that have dominated this discourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical writings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand the contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political developments of the 20th and 21st centuries.  Three common themes will characterise the course:�  We privilege the study of the legal and social reality and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional.�  We seek to illustrate the practical tensions posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood.�  We seek to examine how popular dissatisfaction with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity.�  Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the res publica, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.",law  international law  religion  islamic banking and finance  reason  india  economy  history  military  middle east social-sciences law

Version Control with Git,Atlassian,Intermediate,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git,"The Version Control with Git course provides  you with a solid, hands-on foundation for understanding the Git version control system.  Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing.   In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently ""know just enough Git to be dangerous"".   There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)  You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux.   This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub).   This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.",version control  command-line interface  git (software)  bitbucket  software  software versioning  github  distributed version control  version control systems  Mergers & Acquisitions computer-science software-development
Linear Regression for Business Statistics,Rice University,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-business-statistics,"Regression Analysis is perhaps the single most important Business Statistics tool used in the industry. Regression is the engine behind a multitude of data analytics applications used for many forms of forecasting and prediction.   This is the fourth course in the specialization, ""Business Statistics and Analysis"". The course  introduces you to the very important tool known as Linear Regression. You will learn to apply various procedures such as dummy variable regressions, transforming variables, and interaction effects. All these are introduced and explained using easy to understand examples in Microsoft Excel. The focus of the course is on understanding and application, rather than detailed mathematical derivations. Note: This course uses the �Data Analysis� tool box which is standard with the Windows version of Microsoft Excel. It is also standard with the 2016 or later Mac version of Excel. However, it is not standard with earlier versions of Excel for Mac.    WEEK 1 Module 1: Regression Analysis: An Introduction In this module you will get introduced to the Linear Regression Model.

The module also introduces the notion of errors, residuals and R-square in a regression model.  Topics covered include: �\tIntroducing the Linear Regression �\tBuilding a Regression Model and estimating it using Excel �\tMaking inferences using the estimated model �\tUsing the Regression model to make predictions �\tErrors, Residuals and R-square    WEEK 2 Module 2: Regression Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Goodness of Fit This module presents different hypothesis tests you could do using the Regression output. These tests are an important part of inference and the module introduces them using Excel based examples. The p-values are introduced along with goodness of fit measures R-square and the adjusted R-square. Towards the end of module we introduce the �Dummy variable regression� which is used to incorporate categorical variables in a regression.   Topics covered include: �\tHypothesis testing in a Linear Regression �\t�Goodness of Fit� measures (R-square, adjusted R-square) �\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)    WEEK 3 Module 3: Regression Analysis: Dummy Variables, Multicollinearity This module continues with the application of Dummy variable Regression. You get to understand the interpretation of Regression output in the presence of categorical variables. Examples are worked out to re-inforce various concepts introduced. The module also explains what is Multicollinearity and how to deal with it.   Topics covered include: �\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression) �\tInterpretation of coefficients and p-values in the presence of Dummy variables �\tMulticollinearity in Regression Models    WEEK 4 Module 4: Regression Analysis: Various Extensions The module extends your understanding of the Linear Regression, introducing techniques such as mean-centering of variables and building confidence bounds for predictions using the Regression model. A powerful regression extension known as �Interaction variables� is introduced and explained using examples. We also study the transformation of variables in a regression and in that context introduce the log-log and the semi-log regression models.   Topics covered include: �\tMean centering of variables in a Regression model �\tBuilding confidence bounds for predictions using a Regression model �\tInteraction effects in a Regression �\tTransformation of variables �\tThe log-log and semi-log regression models",Regression Analysis  linearity  Multicollinearity  Regression  Log Log Plot  interaction (statistics)  linear regression  Microsoft Excel  analysis  General Statistics data-science data-analysis

Introduction to numerical analysis,National Research University Higher School of Economics,Conversant,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-numerical-analysis,"Numerical computations historically play a crucial role in natural sciences and engineering. These days however, it�s not only traditional �hard sciences�: whether you do digital humanities or biotechnology, whether you design novel materials or build artificial intelligence systems, virtually any quantitative work involves some amount of numerical computing .  These days, you hardly ever implement the whole computation yourselves from scratch. We rely on libraries which package tried-and-tested, battle-hardened numerical primitives. It is vanishingly rare however that a library contains a single pre-packaged routine which does all what you need. Numerical computing involves assembling these building blocks into computational pipelines. This kind of work requires a general understanding of basic numerical methods, their strengths and weaknesses, their limitations and their failure modes.   And this is exactly what this course is about. It is meant to be an introductory, foundational course in numerical analysis, with the focus on basic ideas. We will review and develop basic characteristics of numerical algorithms (convergence, approximation, stability, computational complexity and so on), and will illustrate them with several classic problems in numerical mathematics. You will also work on implementing abstract mathematical constructions into working prototypes of numerical code. Upon completion of this course, you will have an overview of the main ideas of numerical computing, and will have a solid foundation for reading up on and working with more Advanced numerical needs of your specific subject area.

Osteoarchaeology: The Truth in Our Bones,Universiteit Leiden,Intermediate,4.5,https://www.coursera.org/learn/truthinourbones-osteoarchaeology-archaeology,"This course is about what we can learn from examining the human skeleton, and how we can use this knowledge to reconstruct the lives of people who lived in the past. In archaeology and anthropology, human skeletal remains can provide unique insights into the past and the present; insights that cannot be gained otherwise. These insights are explored in five main themes spread out over five weeks of learning. First, it is shown how age-at-death, sex and stature can be estimated by the close examination of (archaeological) skeletal remains. In subsequent modules it is shown how human bones can provide information about the diseases and injuries that people suffered from and what they ate. Also, it is shown how the human skeleton provides information about the kinds of activities that people engaged in and about how they migrated and moved around their landscapes.   In this course, you will examine all aspects of the human skeleton that can provide us with information about these different facets of life. Together we will explore the scientific field that is known as human osteoarchaeology.  - Human, because it is about us and our ancestors,  - Osteo, because it is about our bones,  - Archaeology, because we use this information to better understand the behaviors and events experienced by past people.   During the course, you will decipher the clues left behind in the skeletons of past peoples with the methods and techniques that are presented. You may also discover some clues hidden in your own skeleton and what they reveal about the life that you are living.   Want to know more?

Planning for Climate Change in African Cities,Erasmus University Rotterdam,Advanced,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-change-africa,"Climate change poses a threat to economic growth and long-term prosperity of many countries around the world. Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.     Furthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously.   At the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change.   The Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities� exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle � from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.  In line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives?   Course Objectives: At the end of this course, learners should be able to:  �\tRecognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities �\tUnderstand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change  �\tDistinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation  �\tExplain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning  �\tExamine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change �\tDevelop a climate change plan based on participants� city contexts",Environmental Studies  Urban Planning  Planning  adaptation  climate change  sustainability  climate resilience  proactivity  Resilience  global city physical-science-and-engineering environmental-science-and-sustainability

Understanding Plants - Part I: What a Plant Knows,Tel Aviv University,Beginner,4.8,https://www.coursera.org/learn/plantknows,"For centuries we have collectively marveled at plant diversity and form�from Charles Darwin�s early fascination with stems and flowers to Seymour Krelborn�s distorted doting in Little Shop of Horrors. This course intends to present an intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience the world�from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We�ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you�ve been playing for them or if they�re just deaf to the sounds around them. We�ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature.   This class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3. To get the student to question life in general and what defines us as humans.

"Advanced Valuation and Strategy - M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital",Erasmus University Rotterdam,Advanced,4.6,https://www.coursera.org/learn/Advanced-valuation-and-strategy,"Hi and welcome to this course!   Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy � M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!  We will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm�s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.  Our treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?  The tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.  * Who is this class for? We hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:  1.Executive Summary:  This 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.  2. Student Level: This level involves an understanding of the technical details.

Participants should complete Parts A and B first -- Part C ""dives right in"" and refers often to material from Part A and Part B.]  This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language �fits together� to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.  This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

Patrick Henry: Forgotten Founder,University of Virginia,Intermediate,4.9,https://www.coursera.org/learn/henry,"�Give me liberty, or give me death:� Remembering Patrick Henry, the Forgotten Founder  \tPatrick Henry was enormously popular during the American Revolution. Even Thomas Jefferson, who over time developed a deep loathing of Henry (some would say jealousy), had to admit that �it is not now easy to say what we should have done without Patrick Henry.� Edmund Randolph, a patriot leader in his own right, explained that �It was Patrick Henry � awakening the genius of his country, and binding a band of patriots together to hurl defiance at the tyranny of so formidable a nation as Great Britain.�  \tYet, today, Patrick Henry is ill-remembered; most Americans might recall at best perhaps a snippet from a famous speech: �give me liberty, or give me death.� The reasons for our historic forgetfulness are several: after the Revolution, Henry chose to oppose ratification of the U.S. Constitution, believing that it created a distant and too-powerful government, and he refused proffered position in George Washington�s administration, diminishing his historic memory. Equally important, Henry died in 1799 shortly after a political campaign in which, at Washington�s behest, he opposed Jefferson�s and James Madison�s ill-advised radical states� rights attack on the U.S. government, and Jefferson spent the next twenty-six years systematically attacking Henry�s legacy. \tPatrick Henry, who helped to ignite a revolution, deserves better. This course will explore how he over�came challenges to reach the pinnacle of Virginia politics and unite Americans behind a challenge to Britain � the eighteenth century�s super-power, why he opposed the U.S. Constitu�tion, and why he then came out of retirement to defend the people�s Constitution against the attacks of Jefferson and Madison.  \tParticipants should evaluate Henry�s role in proclaiming a revolution and consider whether he had an equally important role in saving it. The course should also develop an improved appreciation for the complex political, economic, and religious forces that shaped the early republic. As a biographical course, it also demonstrates how personalities play an important role in even the most foundational national history.   Image Attribution: The background image for this webpage is Patrick Henry before the Virginia House of Burgesses by Peter F. Rothermel (1851) with special thanks to the owner, the Patrick Henry Memorial Foundation. The painting of Patrick Henry's 1765 ""Caesar had his Brutus"" speech (discussed in the second lecture) is entirely romanticized -- neither Henry nor the House of Burgesses looked at all like this -- but it does show that hagiography of Henry, almost god-like veneration, began shortly after this death.",retirement  Causality  career  history of the book  blame  Influencing  resource  history  fundraising  Dependent And Independent Variables arts-and-humanities history
